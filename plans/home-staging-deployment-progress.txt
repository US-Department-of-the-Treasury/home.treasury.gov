## Iteration 1 - Add custom domain variables and data sources to Terraform
- Completed: Added variables for domain_name, enable_custom_domain, route53_zone_name. Added Route53 zone data source.
- Files changed: terraform/variables.tf, terraform/main.tf
- Learnings: Used conditional count on data source for optional custom domain support
- Next: Create ACM certificate with DNS validation

## Iteration 2 - Create ACM certificate with DNS validation
- Completed: Added ACM certificate in us-east-1, Route53 validation records, and validation waiter
- Files changed: terraform/main.tf
- Learnings: Used for_each with conditional for DNS validation records to handle dynamic validation options
- Next: Update CloudFront distribution with custom domain and certificate

## Iteration 3 - Update CloudFront distribution with custom domain and certificate
- Completed: Added aliases and updated viewer_certificate to use ACM cert conditionally
- Files changed: terraform/main.tf
- Learnings: depends_on cannot be conditional, but implicit dependencies through resource references work
- Next: Create Route53 A and AAAA records for CloudFront

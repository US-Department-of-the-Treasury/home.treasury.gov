## Iteration 1 - Add custom domain variables and data sources to Terraform
- Completed: Added variables for domain_name, enable_custom_domain, route53_zone_name. Added Route53 zone data source.

- Next: Update CloudFront distribution with custom domain and certificate

## Iteration 3 - Update CloudFront distribution with custom domain and certificate
- Completed: Added aliases and updated viewer_certificate to use ACM cert conditionally
- Files changed: terraform/main.tf

## Iteration 4 - Create Route53 A and AAAA records for CloudFront
- Completed: Added A and AAAA alias records pointing to CloudFront distribution
- Files changed: terraform/main.tf

## Iteration 5 - Update Terraform outputs for custom domain
- Completed: Added custom_domain and certificate_arn outputs, updated site_url to use custom domain
- Files changed: terraform/outputs.tf

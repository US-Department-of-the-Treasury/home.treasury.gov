Tax expenditures are provisions in the tax code that reduce tax liability through exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, deferrals, and preferential tax rates.

### What Are Tax Expenditures?

Tax expenditures represent government spending through the tax code rather than direct appropriations. They include:

- **Exclusions** - Income not subject to tax (e.g., employer health insurance)
- **Deductions** - Amounts subtracted from income (e.g., mortgage interest)
- **Credits** - Direct reductions in tax liability (e.g., child tax credit)
- **Preferential Rates** - Lower rates on certain income (e.g., capital gains)
- **Deferrals** - Postponement of tax (e.g., retirement savings)

### Tax Expenditure Analysis

Treasury publishes annual estimates of tax expenditures that:
- Quantify revenue effects of each provision
- Enable comparison with direct spending programs
- Inform policy discussions
- Support budget transparency

### Major Tax Expenditures

The largest tax expenditures typically include:

#### For Individuals
- Exclusion of employer contributions for health insurance
- Preferential rates on capital gains and dividends
- Deduction for mortgage interest
- Exclusion of contributions to retirement plans
- Child tax credit

#### For Businesses
- Deferral of active income of controlled foreign corporations
- Accelerated depreciation

### Policy Considerations

Tax expenditure analysis helps policymakers:
- Evaluate the cost of tax provisions
- Compare tax subsidies to direct spending
- Consider distributional effects
- Assess effectiveness of tax incentives

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires foreign financial institutions to report information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers to the IRS.

### Purpose

FATCA was enacted to:
- Combat offshore tax evasion by U.S. persons
- Increase compliance with U.S. tax obligations
- Provide transparency about foreign financial accounts
- Strengthen tax administration

### Key Requirements

#### For Foreign Financial Institutions (FFIs)
FFIs must:
- Register with the IRS
- Conduct due diligence on accounts
- Report information about U.S. account holders
- Withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant entities

#### For U.S. Taxpayers
U.S. persons with foreign financial accounts may need to:
- Report foreign accounts on FBAR (FinCEN Form 114)
- Report specified foreign financial assets on Form 8938
- Include foreign income on tax returns

### Intergovernmental Agreements (IGAs)

Treasury has negotiated IGAs with over 100 countries that:
- Facilitate FATCA implementation
- Provide reciprocal information exchange
- Reduce compliance burdens for FFIs
- Ensure legal framework for reporting

#### Types of IGAs
- **Model 1 IGA** - FFIs report to local government, which exchanges with IRS
- **Model 2 IGA** - FFIs report directly to IRS with local government consent

### Compliance

FFIs should:
- Register on the IRS FATCA Registration Portal
- Implement FATCA compliance programs
- Conduct annual certifications
- Report required information

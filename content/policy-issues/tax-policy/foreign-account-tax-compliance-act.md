Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act

FATCA was enacted in 2010 by Congress to target non-compliance by U.S. taxpayers using foreign accounts.

FATCA requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to report to the IRS information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, or by foreign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold a substantial ownership interest. FFIs are encouraged to either directly register with the IRS to comply with the FATCA regulations (and FFI agreement, if applicable) or comply with the FATCA Intergovernmental Agreements (IGA) treated as in effect in their jurisdictions.  For access to the FATCA regulations and administrative guidance related to FATCA and to learn about taxpayer obligations please visit the Internal Revenue Service FATCA Page.

Scroll down below the Table of FATCA Agreements and Understandings by Jurisdiction to find a list of Model Intergovernmental Agreements and assorted additional statements related to FATCA and its implementation.

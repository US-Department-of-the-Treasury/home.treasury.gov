The U.S. Department of the Treasury submits semiannual reports to Congress examining the macroeconomic and foreign exchange policies of America's major trading partners.

### Legal Requirement

The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, as amended, requires Treasury to report on:

2. **Current Account Surplus** - Global current account surplus exceeding 3% of GDP
3. **Foreign Exchange Intervention** - Net purchases of foreign exchange exceeding 2% of GDP

### Findings

- **Designated as Currency Manipulator** - Formally determined to be manipulating

### Policy Actions

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)

CFIUS is an interagency committee authorized to review certain transactions involving foreign investment in the United States and certain real estate transactions by foreign persons, in order to determine the effect of such transactions on the national security of the United States.

CFIUS operates pursuant to section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (section 721), and as implemented by Executive Order 11858, as amended, and the regulations at chapter VIII of title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

INFORMATION ON CFIUS KNOWN INVESTOR PILOT PROGRAM

Pursuant to the President’s directive in the America First Investment Policy (February 21, 2025), CFIUS is developing a program that aims to facilitate greater investment in the United States from allies and partners.  Referred to as the Known Investor Program (KIP), this effort seeks to increase CFIUS process efficiencies through collecting information from eligible foreign investors in advance of a filing with CFIUS.  As an initial step, Treasury is conducting a pilot of the program with a limited number of investors to inform the program’s development.

Treasury will provide additional information regarding the KIP as the pilot program progresses.  Neither the KIP nor the pilot program will change the Committee’s jurisdiction over transactions by foreign persons or the process laid out in section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended.  Treasury will seek feedback from the public during the development of the KIP, including during the pilot program, and additional information will be made available over time.

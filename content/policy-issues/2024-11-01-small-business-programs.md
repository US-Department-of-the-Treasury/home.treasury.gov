### State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI)

SSBCI supports state programs that, in turn, use the funds to support private sector loans and investments to small businesses and small manufacturers that are creditworthy but are not able to access the capital they need to expand and create jobs.

### Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF)

The Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) provided capital to qualified community banks and community development loan funds (CDLFs) to encourage these institutions and Main Street businesses to work together to promote economic growth and create new jobs. Through the SBLF program, Treasury invested over $4.0 billion in 332 institutions, structured to incentivize increased small business lending.

### Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund)

The CDFI Fund promotes economic revitalization and community development in low-income communities through investment in and assistance to mission-driven lenders known as Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and other community development organizations. The CDFI Fund accomplishes this goal through the Community Development Financial Institutions Program, the New Markets Tax Credit Program, the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program, the Bank Enterprise Award Program and the Native American CDFI Assistance Program.

### Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization

The Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization assists, counsels, and advises small businesses of all types (small businesses, small disadvantaged business, women-owned small businesses, economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses, veteran owned small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses, and small businesses located in historically underutilized business zones) on procedures for contracting with Treasury.

### Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC) Small Business Resource Guides

The Interagency Community Investment Committee (ICIC) is a coalition of agencies with a focus on aligning federal investments to support economic growth in historically underserved communities and address economic disparities. These toolkits provide information on federally available small business resources. These guides are intended to help small business owners connect to resources specifically available to them in their local community.

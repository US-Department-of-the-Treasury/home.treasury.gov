### [Daily Treasury PAR Yield Curve Rates](/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value=202601)

This par yield curve, which relates the par yield on a security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid prices on the most recently auctioned Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market. The par yields are derived from input market prices, which are indicative quotations obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at approximately 3:30 PM each business day. For information on how the Treasury’s yield curve is derived, visit our [Treasury Yield Curve Methodology page](/policy-issues/treasury-borrowing/interest-rate-statistics/treasury-yield-curve-methodology).

Treasury ceased publication of the 30-year constant maturity series on February 18, 2002 and resumed that series on February 9, 2006. To estimate a 30-year rate during that time frame, this series includes the Treasury 20-year Constant Maturity rate and an "adjustment factor," which may be added to the 20-year rate to estimate a 30-year rate during the period of time in which Treasury did not issue the 30-year bonds. Detailed information is provided with the data

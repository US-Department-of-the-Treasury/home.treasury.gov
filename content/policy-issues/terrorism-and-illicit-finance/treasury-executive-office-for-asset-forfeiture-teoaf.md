### About

Established in 1992, the Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture (TEOAF) was established to affirmatively influence the consistent and strategic use of asset forfeiture to disrupt and dismantle criminal enterprises. Asset forfeiture is a vital legal tool that serves a number of compelling law enforcement purposes and is designed to deprive criminals of the proceeds of their crimes, to break the financial backbone of organized criminal syndicates and drug cartels, and to recover property that may be used to compensate victims and deter crime.

TEOAF administers the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF), which is the receipt account for the deposit of non-tax forfeitures made pursuant to laws enforced or administered by Treasury and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) law enforcement agencies:

- [Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations Division (IRS-CI),](https://www.irs.gov/compliance/criminal-investigation/what-criminal-investigation-does)U.S. Department of the Treasury;
- [U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP),](https://www.cbp.gov/)Department of Homeland Security;
- [U.S. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI),](https://www.ice.gov/about-ice/homeland-security-investigations) Department of Homeland Security;
- [U.S. Secret Service (USSS),](https://www.secretservice.gov/)Department of Homeland Security;
- [U.S. Coast Guard](https://www.uscg.mil/), Department of Homeland Security.

Other statutory member agencies include the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), and the Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).

The TFF is a special fund, i.e. a federal fund collection earmarked by law for a specific purpose. The enabling legislation for TFF (Title 31 U.S.C. § 9705) defines those purposes for which Treasury forfeiture revenue may be used. The funds can be allocated and used without the enactment of an annual appropriation by the Congress.

TEOAF’s priorities in administering the Treasury forfeiture program are to:

- Administer and manage the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF) program in a fiscally responsible manner that seeks to minimize administrative costs and maximize the benefits for law enforcement and the compensation of eligible victims.
- Ensure program policies protect due process rights of individuals.
- Focus resources on strategic cases and investigations that result in actions against high profile criminals and criminal enterprises to affect the greatest financial damage to criminal organizations.
- Foster a strong working relationship between federal and state or local law enforcement agencies.

Additional information about the TFF is included in the following Treasury orders and Directives:

- [Treasury Directive 15-04](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/orders-and-directives/td15-04)
- [Treasury Order 102-14](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/orders-and-directives/treasury-order-102-14)

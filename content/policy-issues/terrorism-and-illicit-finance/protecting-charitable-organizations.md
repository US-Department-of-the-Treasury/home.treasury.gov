Protecting Charitable Organizations

Protecting charities from terrorist abuse is a critical component of the global fight against terrorism. Charities provide essential services, comfort, and hope to those in need around the world. Unfortunately, terrorists have exploited the charitable sector to raise and move funds, provide logistical support, encourage terrorist recruitment, or otherwise support terrorist organizations and operations. This abuse threatens to undermine donor confidence and jeopardizes the integrity of the charitable sector, whose services are indispensable to the world community.

Treasury’s Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crime has developed this Web site to provide information and resources for all stakeholders in four strategic areas:  i) private sector outreach; ii) coordinated oversight; iii) targeted investigations; and iv) international engagement.  Treasury hopes this information will be useful for federal, state, local, and private actors in combating terrorist abuse of the charitable sector.

PRIVATE SECTOR OUTREACH

Direct private sector outreach is a particularly important element of the U.S. approach to safeguarding charities from terrorist abuse. The government and the charitable sector share fundamental interests in promoting and protecting charitable giving. Through active engagement, the government and private sector can identify terrorist financing risks, clarify obligations and best practices, facilitate compliance with U.S. law, and help promote charitable giving while reducing the threats of terrorist abuse.

---

Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to require domestic financial institutions to take special measures against foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions, or transactions that are of primary money laundering concern.

### What Is Section 311?

Section 311 provides powerful tools to protect the U.S. financial system from money laundering risks. It allows Treasury to:
- Require enhanced due diligence
- Mandate special recordkeeping
- Impose restrictions on correspondent accounts
- Prohibit certain accounts or transactions

### Special Measures Available

Treasury may impose one or more of five special measures:

1. **Recordkeeping and Reporting** - Additional records on transactions
2. **Beneficial Ownership** - Information about owners of accounts
3. **Payable-Through Accounts** - Information about sub-account holders
4. **Correspondent Accounts** - Information about correspondent account use
5. **Prohibition** - Prohibition on opening or maintaining correspondent or payable-through accounts

### Process

1. **Finding** - Treasury finds a jurisdiction, institution, or transaction type is of primary money laundering concern
2. **Notice** - Treasury publishes a notice of proposed rulemaking
3. **Comment** - Public may submit comments
4. **Final Rule** - Treasury issues a final rule imposing measures

### Past Actions

Treasury has taken Section 311 actions against:
- Banks facilitating money laundering
- Jurisdictions with weak AML controls
- Financial institutions serving sanctions evaders
- Banks associated with North Korea

### Effect of Actions

Section 311 designations effectively isolate targeted entities from the U.S. financial system, as U.S. banks must close or restrict correspondent accounts.

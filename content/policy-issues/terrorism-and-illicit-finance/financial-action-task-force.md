Created by the G-7 in 1989 in response to a growing concern about money laundering, the FATF's mission is to monitor members' progress in implementing necessary measures, review money laundering and terrorist financing techniques and counter-measures, and promote the adoption and implementation of appropriate measures globally. Members of the TFI staff chair the U.S. delegation to the FATF, and it has been an important organization resource in centralizing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The delegation, which also includes members of the Departments of State and Justice, the National Security Council, and federal financial regulators, develops U.S. positions, represent the U.S. at FATF meetings, and implement actions domestically to meet the U.S. commitment to the FATF.

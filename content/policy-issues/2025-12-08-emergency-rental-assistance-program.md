### Keeping Families in their Homes

Treasury’s Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) programs have collectively provided communities over $46 billion to support[housing stability for eligible renters](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ARP_Housing_Investment_Impact_Stories.pdf)throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

[Participating governments have leveraged ERA funding](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/emergency-rental-assistance-supporting-renting-families-driving-lasting-reform)to make over 10 million assistance payments to renters facing eviction, and[research has shown that ERA assistance has supported low-income renters and renters of color](https://oes.gsa.gov/projects/era-equity/). Combined with[other Administration initiatives](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Equitable_Recovery_report.pdf), Treasury’s ERA programs have helped to prevent millions of evictions since the onset of the pandemic.

Two separate ERA programs have been established: the ERA1 program was authorized by the[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/era-1-program-statute-section-501.pdf)and provided $25 billion to assist eligible households with financial assistance and housing stability services. The ERA2 program was authorized by the[American Rescue Plan Act of 2021](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/era-2-program-statute-section-3201.pdf)and provides $21.55 billion to assist eligible households with financial assistance, provide housing stability services, and as applicable, to cover the costs for other affordable rental housing and eviction prevention activities. Financial assistance can include the payment of rent, rental arrears, utilities and home energy costs, utilities and home energy costs arrears, and certain other expenses related to housing. ERA funds are provided directly to states, U.S. territories, certain local governments1, and in the case of ERA1, Indian Tribes or their Tribally Designated Housing Entities and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.

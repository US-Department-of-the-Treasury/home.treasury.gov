To support coordinated departmental Tribal policy, the Office works across Treasury and IRS offices to advise on economic programs, tax policies, and other policy matters that impact Tribal and Native communities. [Treasury Directive 19-07](/about/general-information/orders-and-directives/treasury-directive-19-07) further outlines the organization and function of the Office of Tribal and Native Affairs.

As the lead for [Tribal consultation](/policy-issues/tribal-affairs/tribal-consultations) and Tribal and Native listening sessions, the Office leads implementation of [Treasury Order 112-04 on Tribal Consultation and Coordination with Tribal Nations Policy](/about/general-information/orders-and-directives/treasury-order-112-04) adopted in 2023. You may find the latest [Treasury Action Plan for Tribal Consultation and Collaboration here.](/system/files/226/Treasury-Action-Plan-Tribal-Consultation.pdf)

The Office also manages the [TTAC](/policy-issues/tribal-affairs/treasury-tribal-advisory-committee) which is a seven-member Tribal advisory committee that advises the Secretary on Tribal tax matters pursuant to the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014, Pub. L. 113- 68.

The Office maintains a weekly newsletter providing updates on Treasury Tribal matters. [You may subscribe to this newsletter here](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USTREAS/subscriber/new?preferences=true). Additionally, the Office’s email for Tribal and Native related inquiries is [tribal.consult@treasury.gov](mailto:tribal.consult@treasury.gov).

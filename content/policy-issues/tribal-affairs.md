Tribal Affairs

The Office of Tribal and Native Affairs is committed to working with Tribal governments and Indigenous communities to promote economic prosperity. The Office is overseen by the Treasurer of the United States. The Office was established in September of 2022 by Treasury to (1) to advise on Tribal policy and program implementation; (2) coordinate Tribal consultations; and (3) manage the Treasury Tribal Advisory Committee (TTAC).

To support coordinated departmental Tribal policy, the Office works across Treasury and IRS offices to advise on economic programs, tax policies, and other policy matters that impact Tribal and Native communities. Treasury Directive 19-07 further outlines the organization and function of the Office of Tribal and Native Affairs.

As the lead for Tribal consultation and Tribal and Native listening sessions, the Office leads implementation of Treasury Order 112-04 on Tribal Consultation and Coordination with Tribal Nations Policy adopted in 2023. You may find the latest Treasury Action Plan for Tribal Consultation and Collaboration here.

The Office also manages the TTAC which is a seven-member Tribal advisory committee that advises the Secretary on Tribal tax matters pursuant to the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014, Pub. L. 113- 68.

The Office maintains a weekly newsletter providing updates on Treasury Tribal matters. You may subscribe to this newsletter here. Additionally, the Office’s email for Tribal and Native related inquiries is tribal.consult@treasury.gov.

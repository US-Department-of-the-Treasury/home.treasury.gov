- Capital Projects Fund Awards Made to States
- Capital Projects Fund Awards Made to Tribal Governments

### PRogram status

The Treasury Department began announcing[awards in June 2022](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0809). To date, CPF has awarded approximately $10 billion for broadband, digital technology, and multi-purpose community facility projects in all states, the District of Columbia, as well as in territories, freely associated states, and for Tribal governments. Recipients estimate that broadband projects will reach over two million locations, and that hundreds of thousands of individuals will be served annually by multi-purpose community facilities.

### Funding objectives

The COVID-19 public health emergency revealed and continues to reinforce our understanding that communities without access to high-quality modern infrastructure, including broadband, face impediments to fully participating in aspects of daily life, such as remote work, telehealth, and distance learning. Treasury launched the Capital Projects Fund to allow recipients to invest in capital assets that meet communities’ critical needs in the short- and long-term, with a key emphasis on making funding available for broadband infrastructure. The Capital Projects Fund aims to:

- Directly support recovery from the COVID-19 public health emergency by strengthening and improving the infrastructure necessary for participation in work, education, and health monitoring that will last beyond the pandemic.
- Enable investments in capital assets designed to address inequities in access to critical services.
- Contribute to the Administration’s goal of providing every American with the modern infrastructure necessary to access critical services, including a high-quality and affordable broadband internet connection.

A key priority of this program is to make funding available for reliable, affordable broadband infrastructure and other digital connectivity technology projects. Recipients may also use funds for certain other capital projects, such as multi-purpose community facilities, that enable work, education, and healthcare monitoring, including remote options. The program encourages recipients to focus on economically distressed areas, support community empowerment, and adopt strong labor practices.

The Capital Projects Fund Guidance provides detailed information on the program:

### Eligible Projects

For a capital project to be an eligible use of Capital Projects Fund grant funds, it must meet all of the following criteria:

1. The capital project invests in capital assets designed to directly enable work, education, and health monitoring.
2. The capital project is designed to address a critical need that resulted from or was made apparent or exacerbated by the COVID-19 public health emergency.
3. The capital project is designed to address a critical need of the community to be served by it.

The following capital projects are identified in the Capital Projects Fund Guidance as being eligible uses of Capital Projects Fund grant funding:

- **Broadband Infrastructure Projects**: the construction and deployment of broadband infrastructure designed to deliver service that reliably meets or exceeds symmetrical speeds of 100Mbps so that communities have future-proof infrastructure to serve their long-term needs.
- **Digital Connectivity Technology Projects**: the purchase or installation of devices and equipment, such as laptops, tablets, desktop personal computers, and public Wi-Fi equipment, to facilitate broadband internet access for communities where affordability is a barrier to broadband adoption and use.
- **Multi-Purpose Community Facility Projects**: the construction or improvement of buildings designed to jointly and directly enable work, education, and health monitoring located in communities with critical need for the project.

**Case-by-Case Review**: In addition to the eligible Capital Projects identified above, recipients may propose a different use of funds. Such uses must meet the statutory criteria, and recipients will be required to demonstrate that any such projects satisfy the eligibility criteria identified in the Capital Projects Fund Guidance.

Capital Projects Fund grant funding can also be used for the ancillary costs related to eligible capital projects that are necessary to put the asset to full use. For example, if an applicant plans for Digital Connectivity Technology Projects, Capital Projects Fund awards can be used to provide digital literacy training to community members so that they gain the knowledge and skills necessary to make full use of the devices in order to conduct activities related to education, work, and health monitoring.

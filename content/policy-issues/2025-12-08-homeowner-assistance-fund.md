The Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF) authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act, provides $9.961 billion to support homeowners facing financial hardship associated with COVID-19. HAF funds were distributed to states, U.S. Territories, and Indian Tribes. Funds from HAF may be used for assistance with mortgage payments, homeowner’s insurance, utility payments, and other specified purposes.

Through June 2024, HAF-funded programs have assisted over 549,000[homeowners](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/ARP_Housing_Investment_Impact_Stories.pdf), helping to prevent mortgage delinquencies and defaults, foreclosures, losses of utilities and home energy services, and displacement. The data shows that the majority of HAF assistance reached economically vulnerable and traditionally underserved homeowners, including low-income homeowners, homeowners of color, and female homeowners. Further, available data has shown that foreclosure filings have remained below pre-pandemic levels.

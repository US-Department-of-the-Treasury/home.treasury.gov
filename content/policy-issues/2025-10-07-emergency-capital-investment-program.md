The Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) provided over $8.57 billion in investments to 175 depository institutions that are certified Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) or minority depository institutions (MDIs). These participating community financial institutions can qualify to lower the rate they pay on Treasury’s investments by increasing their lending and other investments in low- and moderate-income, rural, and minority communities.

Impact Highlights

ECIP participants advance the statutory goal of providing financing and other resources to financially underserved borrowers and communities, including by:

- Providing loans and technical assistance to low- and moderate-income borrowers,
- Lending in rural communities, on tribal lands and in U.S. territories,
- Opening access to capital for small businesses, and
- Financing the production of affordable rental housing and providing mortgages to financially underserved homebuyers.

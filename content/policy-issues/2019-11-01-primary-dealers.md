Primary dealers are trading counterparties of the New York Fed in its implementation of monetary policy. They are also expected to make markets for the New York Fed on behalf of its official accountholders as needed, and to bid on a pro-rata basis in all Treasury auctions at reasonably competitive prices.

[The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on its website provides more information on primary dealers, including a list of current primary dealers](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealers.html).

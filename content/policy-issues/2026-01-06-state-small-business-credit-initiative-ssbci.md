The State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) is a nearly $10 billion program to support small businesses and entrepreneurship in communities across the United States by providing capital and technical assistance to promote small business stability, growth, and success.

SSBCI represents a transformational investment in American small businesses and is expected to catalyze up to $10 of private investment for every $1 of SSBCI Capital Program funding to increase access to capital to small businesses and entrepreneurs, including those in underserved communities.

Reauthorized and expanded by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), the SSBCI Capital Program provides funds to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments for those jurisdictions to create tailored programs that offer funding to small businesses and entrepreneurs through equity/venture capital, loan participation, loan guarantee, collateral support, and capital access programs.

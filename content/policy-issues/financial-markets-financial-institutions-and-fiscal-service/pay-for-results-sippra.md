## Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act (SIPPRA)

The Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act (SIPPRA), enacted as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, authorizes up to $100 million in federal funding for state and local pay-for-results projects.

### About SIPPRA

SIPPRA supports innovative social programs that address pressing social challenges while holding providers accountable for achieving measurable outcomes. Under pay-for-results contracts, the government pays only when predetermined outcomes are achieved.

### Program Structure

#### Outcome Payments
- Federal outcome payments for successful social impact partnership projects
- Payments tied to achievement of predetermined social outcomes
- Projects must demonstrate cost savings or cost avoidance

#### Feasibility Studies
- Funding for feasibility studies to develop project proposals
- Support for states and local governments exploring pay-for-results models
- Technical assistance for project design

### Priority Outcome Areas

SIPPRA focuses on measurable improvements in:

- **Employment and Economic Opportunity**: Job training, employment support, economic mobility
- **Education**: Early childhood education, K-12 outcomes, post-secondary completion
- **Health**: Maternal and child health, chronic disease management, behavioral health
- **Child Welfare**: Child safety, permanency, family stability
- **Criminal Justice**: Recidivism reduction, reentry support

### How It Works

1. **Project Proposal**: State or local government submits a project application
2. **Federal Review**: Treasury and Commission evaluate proposals
3. **Agreement**: Successful applicants enter into pay-for-results agreements
4. **Implementation**: Service providers deliver interventions
5. **Evaluation**: Independent evaluators measure outcomes
6. **Payment**: Federal outcome payments made when targets are achieved

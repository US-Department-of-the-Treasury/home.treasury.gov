1603 Program: Payments for Specified Energy Property in Lieu of Tax Credits

The Department of the Treasury has responsibilities pursuant to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act).  Among those responsibilities are several programs, including the 1603 Program:  Payments for Specified Energy Property in Lieu of Tax Credits.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The Section 1603 program was created as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 to increase investment in domestic clean energy production.  Under Section 1603 the Department of the Treasury made payments in lieu of investment tax credits to eligible applicants for specified energy property used in a trade or business or for the production of income.  The purpose of the 1603 payment was to reimburse eligible applicants for a portion of the cost of installing the specified energy property.  Specified energy property includes solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, fuel cells, hydropower, combined heat and power, landfill gas, municipal solid waste, and microturbine property.

Applicants were required to submit a completed application containing detailed information about the project, as well as supporting documentation demonstrating that (1) the property was eligible, (2) the property had been placed in service, and (3) the requested payment amount was accurate.

PROGRAM RESULTS

The Section 1603 Program has disbursed over $26 billion to help fund 109,766 clean energy projects that are estimated to produce enough clean energy to power over 8.5 million homes. The awards vary in size ranging from $180.00 to over $500 million and include projects located throughout the United States and the U.S. Territories.  For more information see the Section 1603 Program Overview.

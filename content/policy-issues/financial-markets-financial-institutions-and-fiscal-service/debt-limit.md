## Debt Limit

The debt limit, or debt ceiling, is the maximum amount of money the U.S. government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations.

### What Is the Debt Limit?

The debt limit is:
- A statutory cap on total federal debt
- Set by Congress through legislation
- Separate from spending and revenue decisions
- A ceiling on borrowing to pay existing obligations

### What the Debt Limit Covers

The debt limit applies to:
- Debt held by the public (Treasury securities)
- Debt held by government accounts (trust funds)
- All federal government borrowing

### Debt Limit vs. Spending

The debt limit is distinct from spending decisions:
- Congress authorizes spending through appropriations
- Spending creates obligations that require borrowing
- The debt limit allows Treasury to borrow to pay existing obligations
- Raising the debt limit does not authorize new spending

### Extraordinary Measures

When debt approaches the limit, Treasury employs extraordinary measures:
- Suspending investments in certain government funds
- Suspending reinvestment of maturing securities
- Other accounting measures to create borrowing room
- Measures eventually exhausted if limit not raised

### Consequences of Default

Failure to raise the debt limit would result in:
- Inability to pay all government obligations on time
- Default on Treasury securities
- Potential financial market disruption
- Economic damage

### Historical Context

Congress has raised or suspended the debt limit many times throughout history to accommodate the growth of federal obligations.

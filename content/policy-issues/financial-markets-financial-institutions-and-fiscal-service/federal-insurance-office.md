Federal Insurance Office

The Federal Insurance Office (FIO) was established under Title V of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

FIO has the authority to monitor all aspects of the insurance sector, monitor the extent to which traditionally underserved communities and consumers have access to affordable non-health insurance products, and to represent the United States on prudential aspects of international insurance matters, including at the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.  In addition, FIO serves as an advisory member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, assists the Secretary with administration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, and advises the Secretary on important national and international insurance matters.

Financial Stability Oversight Council

Established in 2010 by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Financial Stability Oversight Council provides comprehensive monitoring of the stability of our nation's financial system.

Information on recent or upcoming Council meetings can be found on the Council Meetings page.

The Council is charged by statute with identifying risks to the financial stability of the United States; promoting market discipline; and responding to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system.

The Council is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and consists of 10 voting members and 5 nonvoting members, bringing together the expertise of federal financial regulators, state regulators, and an independent insurance expert appointed by the President.

The Council brings together its members to assess, monitor, and respond to risks to U.S. financial stability; improves communication with the public regarding these risks through reports and other publications; and facilitates cooperation and communication among member agencies on financial stability-related matters. Under Secretary Bessent’s leadership, the Council is incorporating the importance of sustainable long-term economic growth and economic security into its financial stability policy and analysis.

The Council’s annual reports outline potential emerging threats and vulnerabilities, such as financial risks related to real estate, credit, and other markets; institutional risks associated with large bank holding companies and investment funds; risks related to the structure of Treasury markets and other financial markets; and cybersecurity and other operational risks.

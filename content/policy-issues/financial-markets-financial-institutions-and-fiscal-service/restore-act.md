On April 20, 2010, an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig drilling in the Gulf caused the largest offshore oil spill in the United States, exacerbating the effects of previous natural disasters. Oil flowed unchecked for three months. Before the well was capped, millions of barrels of crude oil were released, closing tens of thousands of square miles of Gulf waters to fishing and causing extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats, and tourism.

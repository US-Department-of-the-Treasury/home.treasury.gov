The State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) is a program administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that provides funding to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments to support small business lending and investment programs.

### Program Overview

SSBCI provides funds to states and other eligible jurisdictions to support programs that increase access to capital for small businesses. These programs include:

- **Capital Access Programs (CAPs)**: Portfolio insurance programs that encourage lending to small businesses
- **Loan Participation Programs**: Programs where states share in the risk of loans to small businesses
- **Loan Guarantee Programs**: Programs that provide guarantees to reduce lender risk
- **Collateral Support Programs**: Programs that pledge cash collateral to lenders
- **Venture Capital Programs**: Equity and near-equity investments in small businesses

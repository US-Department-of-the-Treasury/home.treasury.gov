Established by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (the Act), the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) is a dedicated fund designed to provide capital to qualified community banks and community development loan funds (CDLFs) in order to encourage small business lending. The purpose of the SBLF is to encourage Main Street banks and small businesses to work together, help create jobs, and promote economic growth in communities across the nation.

Treasury invested over $4.0 billion in 332 institutions through the SBLF program. These amounts include investments of $3.9 billion in 281 community banks and $104 million in 51 CDLFs. Collectively, these institutions operate in over 3,000 locations across 47 states and the District of Columbia.

#### Benefits to the Nation's Economy

As of Sep 30, 2024, institutions participating in SBLF have made important progress in increasing their small business lending, helping to support small businesses and local economies across the nation.

- As of Q3 2025, the total cumulative net impact on qualified small business lending (or QSBL) over the baseline reported by current and former SBLF participants is $19.1 billion. As established in the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the baseline is the average of the amounts reported for the four calendar quarters ended June 30, 2010.
- As of December 1, 2025, 327 institutions with aggregate investments of $3.95 billion have fully redeemed their SBLF Treasury investment and exited the program, and 1 institution has partially redeemed $3.5 million (or 70 percent of its SBLF securities) while continuing to participate in the program.

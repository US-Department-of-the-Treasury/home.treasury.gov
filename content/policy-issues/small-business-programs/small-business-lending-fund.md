## Small Business Lending Fund

The Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF) was a dedicated fund that provided capital to community banks to encourage lending to small businesses.

### Program Overview

Created by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, SBLF:
- Provided Treasury capital to qualified community banks and CDFIs
- Encouraged increased small business lending
- Offered incentive-based pricing tied to lending growth
- Focused on banks under $10 billion in assets

### How It Worked

#### Capital Investment
Treasury invested capital in eligible institutions:
- Non-voting preferred stock or equivalent
- Capital for lending, not operations
- Subject to lending growth requirements

#### Incentive Pricing
Dividend rates decreased as small business lending increased:
- Base rate with reductions for lending growth
- Encouragement to lend more to small businesses
- Alignment of bank and public interest

### Eligible Institutions

The program was open to:
- Community banks with less than $10 billion in assets
- Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)
- Institutions not recipients of TARP capital

### Program Results

SBLF:
- Deployed billions in capital
- Supported hundreds of financial institutions
- Increased small business lending
- Reached underserved communities

### Program Status

The SBLF program has wound down:
- Investment period closed
- Funds have been repaid or are being monitored
- Legacy reporting continues

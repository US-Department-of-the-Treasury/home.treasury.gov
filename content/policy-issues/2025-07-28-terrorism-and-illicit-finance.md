The Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence marshals the department's intelligence and enforcement functions with the twin aims of safeguarding the financial system against illicit use and combating rogue nations, terrorist facilitators, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferators, money launderers, drug kingpins, and other national security threats.

 

### 311 Actions

Actions taken under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act.

 

### Asset Forfeiture

Effective law enforcement actions against criminal enterprises, from drug cartels to terrorist organizations, require depriving them of their enabling assets and profits that support or stem from their existence. The Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF) is derived from the forfeited assets of criminal enterprises.

 

### Financial Action Task Force

The Financial Action Task Force is an international policy-making and standard-setting body dedicated to combating money laundering and terrorist financing.

 

### Financial Sanctions

### Money Laundering

How Treasury combats money laundering at home and abroad.

 

### Terrorist Finance Tracking Program

The Treasury Department initiated the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program to identify, track, and pursue terrorists and their networks. Since that time, the TFTP has provided valuable leads that have aided in the prevention or investigation of many of the most visible and violent terrorist attacks and attempted attacks of the past decade.

The Treasury Department's primary goal in debt management policy is to finance the government at the lowest cost over time. To meet this objective we issue debt in a regular and predictable manner, provide transparency in our decision-making, and seek continuous improvements in the auction process. In creating and executing our financing plans, we must contend with various uncertainties and potential challenges, such as unexpected changes in our borrowing needs, changes in the demand for our securities, and anything that inhibits efficient and timely sales of our securities. To manage these risks, we closely monitor economic conditions, fiscal policy, and market activity, and, where appropriate, respond with appropriate changes in debt issuance based on our analysis and consultation with market participants.

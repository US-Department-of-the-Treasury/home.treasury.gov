Treasury estimates the current law distribution of income and taxes as part of the Budget baseline exercise.  Current law income and tax burdens are estimates of income and tax burdens for the first year of the Budget period, assuming baseline tax law and Administration forecast of income and other economic variables.[Technical Paper 8](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/TP-8.pdf)provides an in-depth description of the methodology.

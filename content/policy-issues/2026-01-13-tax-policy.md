### Tax Expenditures

Tax Expenditures describe revenue losses attributable to provisions of Federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which provide a special credit, a preferential rate of tax, or a deferral of tax liability. These exceptions are often viewed as alternatives to other policy instruments, such as spending or regulatory programs.[Tax Expenditure Budget for Fiscal Year 2027](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/Tax-Expenditures-FY2026.pdf)[[Excel Tables]](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/Tax-Expenditures-FY2026.xlsx)

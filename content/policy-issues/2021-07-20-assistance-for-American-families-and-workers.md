### Unemployment Compensation

The American Rescue Plan extended employment assistance, starting in March 2021, and waived some federal taxes on unemployment benefits to assist those who lost work due to the COVID-19 crisis.

### Child Tax Credit

The American Rescue Plan increased the Child Tax Credit and expanded its coverage to better assist families who care for children.

 

### EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE

The Emergency Rental Assistance program makes funding available to government entities to assist households that are unable to pay rent or utilities.

The Department of Treasury’s annual Agency Financial Report provides financial and performance results that enable the President, Congress, and the American people to assess our accomplishments for each fiscal year (October 1st through September 30th).

This report provides an overview of our programs, accomplishments, challenges, and management’s accountability for the resources entrusted to us. The report is prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements. Treasury has made every effort to make these documents accessible, but if you are having any problems with accessibility please contact us for assistance.

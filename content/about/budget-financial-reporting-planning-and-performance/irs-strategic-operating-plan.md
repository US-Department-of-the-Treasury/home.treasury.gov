IRS Strategic Operating Plan

President Biden in August 2022 signed the Inflation Reduction Act, providing critical resources to modernize the IRS after decades of underfunding. The Strategic Operating Plan shows how the IRS will use Inflation Reduction Act resources to provide taxpayers with world class customer service and reduce our deficits by hundreds of billions by pursuing high dollar noncompliance.

Thanks to Inflation Reduction Act resources, the IRS will transform the taxpayer experience. The IRS will help taxpayers get it right, and taxpayers will be able to seamlessly interact with the agency in the ways that work best for them. For the first time, the IRS will help taxpayers claim the credits and deductions for which they are eligible. These improvements will enable the IRS to serve all taxpayers fairly and in the way they want to be served.

Along with IRS’ annual discretionary budget, the Inflation Reduction Act investment over 10 years will transform the IRS so that it provides world class service to taxpayers, helps taxpayers get it right the first time, ensures high earners and corporations pay the taxes they owe, and supports the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy investments.

Treasury’s mission is to maintain a strong economy by promoting conditions that enable equitable and sustainable economic growth at home and abroad, combating threats to, and protecting the integrity of the financial system, and managing the U.S. government's finances and resources effectively.

The nearly 100,000 dedicated Treasury employees strive to maintain integrity and uphold the public trust in all that we do, explore better ways of conducting business through innovation, seek diversity of thought and expertise to inform our decisions, embrace and adapt to change, and hold ourselves accountable for accomplishing meaningful results for the American public.

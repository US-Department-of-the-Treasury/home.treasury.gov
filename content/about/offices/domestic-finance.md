Domestic Finance works to unleash the full potential of the U.S. economy to improve the lives of Americans on every rung of the economic ladder. It seeks to foster economic growth through regulatory reforms that ensure the financial system delivers for both Wall Street and Main Street. Domestic Finance also manages the finances of the U.S. government, including the Treasury’s debt management and the collections and disbursement of public monies.

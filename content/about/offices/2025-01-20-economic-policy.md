### History

The primary mission of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy is to support the Secretary of the Treasury as the principal economic official in the government. The Office utilizes economic analysis and evaluates current economic data to assist in the determination of appropriate economic policies.

The Office of Financial Analysis, the precursor to the Office of Economic Policy, was established in late 1961 to advise the Secretary on a broad range of economic problems. Its first director was Paul Volcker (1962-1963). Under his leadership the Office undertook research projects and analyzed current developments in the economy. This Office formed the basis of the new Office of the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy which was established on April 1, 1969. Dr. Murray Weidenbaum, the first Assistant Secretary, was sworn in on June 23, 1969.

Since the early 1970s, the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy has served on the Troika, the unofficial name of the interagency group comprised of Treasury, the Council of Economic Advisors, and the Office of Management and Budget, that develops official economic assumptions for the President’s budget. In addition, the Assistant Secretary advises the Secretary on the economic effects of tax and budget policy.

Since the late 1970s, the Office of Economic Policy has provided the principal support to the Secretary of the Treasury in his roles as Chairman and Managing Trustee of the Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees. The Secretary, along with the other Trustees, sets the short-range and long-range economic and demographic assumptions used in determining the financial status of the Social Security and Medicare programs as reported annually to Congress.

In both the late 1970s and mid-1990s, the Office of Economic Policy was an important participant in the interagency groups working on health care reforms initiated by the White House. Between 1990 and 1998, the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy had major responsibility for the analysis and collection of Treasury’s statistics on international capital movements.  The Assistant Secretary continues to analyze international economic issues as they relate to the domestic economy.

One of the responsibilities of the new Office in the early 1970s was to put together the Revenue Sharing Program whereby a portion of federal tax dollars and decision-making power were shifted back to state and local governments. Since 1987, when Revenue Sharing was disbanded, the Office of Economic Policy has continued to study state and local finance issues and produces the index of Total Taxable Resources used in certain allocations among states of federal funds for Medicaid.

Today, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy carries out its functions under the direction of an Assistant Secretary. Staff economists in two offices, the Office of Macroeconomic Analysis and the Office of Microeconomic Analysis, provide the economic analysis and often collaborate with other policy offices in Treasury, including the Office of Tax Policy, the Office of Domestic Finance, and the Office of International Affairs, on a wide variety of policy issues. The Office also works with other cabinet departments and government agencies in the development of policy.

The Office of Macroeconomic Analysis routinely monitors U.S. economic data as they are released and provides the Secretary of the Treasury and other officials with daily updates and analysis of important economic statistics. In addition, the Office of Macroeconomic Analysis regularly provides in-depth analyses of major trends and developments in the U.S. economy. It also produces a suite of yield curve data sets that are made available to the public each month, including the HQM corporate bond yield curve (as mandated by the Pension Protection Act of 2006), the TNC yield curve for Treasury nominal notes and bonds, the TRC TIPS yield curve, and the TBI breakeven inflation yield curve.

The Office of Microeconomic Analysis conducts research to assist in the formulation of Treasury’s policies on a wide range of issues. Staff economists also represent the Treasury in interagency groups studying a variety of issues, including Social Security, environmental, energy, housing, infrastructure, and labor force and education policies. The Office of Microeconomic Analysis is currently responsible for implementing the Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act (SIPPRA), which will reward states and localities for successfully addressing entrenched social problems.

Economists also monitor certain sectors of the economy; work to improve the presentation of governmental financial statements; and perform research and analysis on policy issues in financial markets.

TFI serves as the national security arm of the U.S. Department of the Treasury with broad responsibilities focused on advancing U.S. national security and foreign policy goals while also protecting the integrity of the U.S. and international financial systems.

### Mission

TFI’s mission is to enhance national security by applying Treasury’s unique policy, enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory tools to identify, disrupt and disable terrorists, criminals, and other national security threats to the United States and to protect the U.S. and international financial systems from abuse by illicit actors.

Each office brings its own unique skills and authorities to the table to help address some of our most pressing foreign policy and national security challenges.

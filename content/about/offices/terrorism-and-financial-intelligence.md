Terrorism and Financial Intelligence

TFI serves as the national security arm of the U.S. Department of the Treasury with broad responsibilities focused on advancing U.S. national security and foreign policy goals while also protecting the integrity of the U.S. and international financial systems.

TFI’s mission is to enhance national security by applying Treasury’s unique policy, enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory tools to identify, disrupt and disable terrorists, criminals, and other national security threats to the United States and to protect the U.S. and international financial systems from abuse by illicit actors.

TFI is composed of over 1,000 dedicated employees spread across one bureau and four offices.  Each office brings its own unique skills and authorities to the table to help address some of our most pressing foreign policy and national security challenges. Learn more about what TFI does and how it does it.

TFI’s five components are:

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is led by the OFAC Director and administers and enforces financial sanctions;

The Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) is led by the OIA Assistant Secretary and is one of the seventeen U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) agencies;

The Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC) is led by the TFFC Assistant Secretary and is responsible for formulating and coordinating anti-money laundering and combatting the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) policies, in addition to developing strategies to deploy the full range of financial authorities to combat national security threats;

Treasury's Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture (TEOAF) is led by the TEOAF Director and administers Treasury’s Forfeiture Fund and partners with and supports Treasury and DHS federal law enforcement agencies; and

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is a bureau led by the FinCEN Director and is responsible for administering the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which imposes money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes compliance obligations on financial institutions.

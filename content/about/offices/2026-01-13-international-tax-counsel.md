In addition to the above, the office is responsible for negotiating and reviewing income tax and estate and gift tax treaties with foreign countries and coordinating tax treaty matters with the State Department and the Congress.  Two important purposes of these treaties are to help reduce international double taxation and thereby facilitate a freer movement of trade and capital flows, and ​to improve taxpayer compliance. In consultation with IRS, ITC is responsible for review of all Treasury regulations and IRS revenue rulings, revenue procedures, and other published guidance relating to international tax issues.

ITC attorneys serve as the official representatives of the United States in various international organizations including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

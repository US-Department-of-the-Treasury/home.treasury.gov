### Treasury’s Writing Your Federal Resume

Come Grow With Us! This presentation was designed to help applicants understand the federal resume. The briefing explains each section of the job opportunity announcement (JOA) in an effort to better inform applicants and to assist them in selecting in or out of the job. The main part of the briefing uses a 3-part process to assist applicants in writing their resume. Attendees are shown a real JOA and walked through a process that helps them review the JOA to determine qualifications and interest, identify the important requirements and then they are shown how to properly tailor their resumes to the JOA. Lastly, we will do a quick overview of the resume builder within USAJOBS.

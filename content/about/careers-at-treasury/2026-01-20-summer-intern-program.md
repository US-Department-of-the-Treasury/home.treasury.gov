Information about Treasury and its components may be found at[https://home.treasury.gov](https://home.treasury.gov).

The internship program offers an opportunity for students to improve research and writing skills, observe the practice of law in a major federal agency, and learn about the wide range of substantive areas of the law that Treasury lawyers and their clients encounter.  We expect a 10-week commitment from our summer interns.

Treasury’s Legal Division is committed to attracting candidates from diverse backgrounds and experiences with first-rate academic and professional credentials.  We seek candidates who possess a strong work ethic, demonstrate a genuine interest in the mission of Treasury, exhibit an attitude of cooperation, dedication, and integrity, and are comfortable working with and presenting views to senior lawyers and policymakers at Treasury.  Candidates must inspire confidence through substantive excellence, effective oral and written communication, critical analysis, and the exercise of good judgment.  We look for team builders with strong interpersonal skills who are adept at building positive relationships with clients and colleagues.

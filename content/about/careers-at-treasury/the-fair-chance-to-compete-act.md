## The Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act

The Fair Chance to Compete for Jobs Act (Fair Chance Act) provides individuals with arrest or conviction records a fair chance to compete for federal employment.

### What Is the Fair Chance Act?

Enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, the Fair Chance Act:

- Delays inquiries into criminal history until after a conditional offer is made
- Applies to most federal civilian positions
- Provides a fair opportunity for qualified candidates

### How It Works at Treasury

#### Before a Conditional Offer
- Job announcements do not ask about criminal history
- Applications do not include questions about arrests or convictions
- Interviews focus on qualifications and job-related factors

#### After a Conditional Offer
- Background investigations are conducted as appropriate

- Candidates may explain circumstances

### Positions Covered

The Fair Chance Act applies to competitive service positions. Some exceptions exist for positions requiring:
- Access to classified information
- Law enforcement functions
- National security duties
- Other specifically exempted categories

### Your Rights Under the Fair Chance Act

If a conditional offer is rescinded based on criminal history, you have the right to:
- Receive written notice of the reasons
- Provide additional information or explanation
- Request reconsideration of the decision
- File a complaint if procedures were not followed

### Background Investigations

Treasury conducts background investigations as required by the position:
- Suitability determinations under 5 CFR Part 731
- Security clearance investigations where required
- Reviews consider the nature and circumstances of any history

### Commitment to Fair Chance

Treasury is committed to:

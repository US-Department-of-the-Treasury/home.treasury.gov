### Overview

The Internship Program is designed for current students in an accredited high school, professional, vocational, and trade school as well as the other qualifying educational institutions. This program allows managers to hire current students outside of their area of study under certain situations. You must be a currently enrolled student to be considered for a Pathways Internship.

### Development

The Internship Program encourages, but does not require mentoring, training, or an IDP for development. Some positions will be available for conversion to permanent positions, others will not. If you are unsure whether the position you are applying to will have the option for any of these benefits, please refer to the job announcement and/or contact the hiring manager.

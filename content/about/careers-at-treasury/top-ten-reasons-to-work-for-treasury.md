Top Ten Reasons to Work for Treasury

DISTINGUISHED MISSION

Treasury has a distinguished history dating back to the founding of our nation.  Today, as the steward of U.S. economic and financial systems, Treasury is a major and influential participant in the global economy.

INFLUENCE ON POLICY

Treasury employees research, analyze and inform policy decision-makers on current and emerging economic issues facing the nation. They collect the taxes that make government work, print the money, issue the checks, and keep track of the nation’s debt.  Your work plays a role in shaping the economy of our country.

PROFESSIONAL WORK ENVIRONMENT

Our primary goal is to maintain the trust of the American people. Our work environment offers open communication and respect of individual contributions so employees are motivated and empowered to perform their job.

PUBLIC SERVICE

Treasury challenges you –on your very first day –to ask yourself, “What can I do today to improve the lives of the American people?” Treasury employees work together to face and meet the economic challenges of our nation and serve the American people.

LEARNING AND GROWTH

Energetic and talented employees work together to collaborate with one another to create a continuous environment of learning. As the nature of our work continues to change and grow, we work to ensure our employees are prepared to meet the challenge. You will have the opportunity to hit the ground running, learning and gaining experience every day.

MULTI-STAGE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES

The Department and its bureaus have unique opportunities for professionals at any career level. Whether you’re just starting out in your career or looking for a later-career challenge as a bridge to retirement, we have a place for you.

LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION

Treasury’s headquarters is located in the heart of Washington, DC with offices on 15th and Pennsylvania, next door to the White House, a few blocks from the McPherson Square and Metro Center metro stations, and close to shops, museums, and restaurants.  We have offices in most major cities across the country.

FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES AND WORK/LIFE BALANCE

We recognize that each employee has unique personal interests and responsibilities to balance with a busy work schedule. In addition to 10 paid holidays, 13–26 vacation days (depending on service), and 13 days of sick leave each year, your manager may be able to offer you flexible work schedules to help you balance work and family.

COMPETITIVE SALARIES AND BENEFITS

We provide competitive salaries and benefits to include great health coverage and retirement plans, 401(k)-type investment plans including matching options, life and long term care insurance, and flexible spending accounts. In addition to our salary and benefits package we offer generous transit subsidies, on-site health offices, fitness centers, and child care programs.

### A. General Information

 

**1. How do I find a job with the Department of the Treasury?**

The Department of the Treasury does not have a centralized hiring office. Each of the Department's 12 bureaus work independently in hiring employees to work for them. The good news is that all Federal agencies are required to post their announcements to the general public on the Office of Personnel Management's[USAJOBS website](https://treasury.usajobs.gov/). Persons interested in finding jobs at the Department of Treasury, or within a specific Treasury bureau, can search by agency or occupation to find a variety of positions. USAJOBS also has a personal search agent that notifies you of job openings matching your specific search criteria.

 

**2. How do I Apply for a job in the Department of the Treasury? **

All positions available in the Department of Treasury are listed at:[usajobs.gov](https://treasury.usajobs.gov/)Treasury bureaus use a variety of application processes, so it is important that you read the “How to Apply” section of each vacancy announcement to which you wish to apply. There are, however, many Treasury positions that require an online application collected via USAJOBS.

 

**3. What if I don't have a computer?**

Most career resource centers, unemployment offices, public libraries, college placement centers and job search agencies have computers and Internet access for their patrons to use at no charge.

 

**4. What if I don't have email?**There are several companies who offer free email accounts, such as Google (Gmail), Yahoo, and Microsoft (Outlook). You can access one of these providers to register for a free email account.

 

**5.  What if I need help applying online?**For assistance in applying for a vacancy, you may contact the Human Resources Specialist listed on the vacancy announcement. If applying online poses a hardship to you, you must call the Human Resources Specialist before the closing date of the announcement to request assistance

 

**6. Will the Department of the Treasury accept paper applications for positions that require an online application?**No. Exceptions will be made in the instance of extreme hardship cases (e.g., applicant lives in a remote area where it would pose a major hardship for the applicant to get to a computer in any location). Applicants requesting an exception must contact the HR Specialist listed in the vacancy announcement prior to the closing date. Applicants who are given an exception must also respond to the same vacancy questions as those applying on-line. The HR Office will input the data into the system on the applicant’s behalf for the specific job for which the applicant has received an exception.

 

**7. What if someone submits false information?**Providing false information, creating fake IDs, or failing to answer all questions truthfully and completely may be grounds for not hiring, for disbarment from federal employment, or for dismissal after a person begins work. Falsifying a federal job application, attempting to violate the privacy of others, or attempting to compromise the operation of this system may be punishable by fine or imprisonment (see US Code, Title 18, section 1001).

 

### B. SYSTEM ACCESS AND LOGON

**1. How do I access USAJOBS?**

The applicant web address is[usajobs.gov](http://www.usajobs.gov/).

 

**2. As an applicant, can I access the system from home?**

Yes. As an applicant, you can access the web site from any location, whether at home or at work.

 

**3. Can I apply for jobs online using my office computer?**

Yes. The Department of the Treasury's policy permits employees to use their office computers and email to apply for jobs. However, you are reminded that you may use government property/resources to apply for jobs only if it does not interfere with the performance of your regular duties. If you work for another federal agency or in the private sector, contact your employer's human resources office for information on whether or not this is acceptable.

  

### C.  ONLINE APPLICATION PROCESS

**1. How do I find out more information about applying for jobs through USAJOBS?**

To learn more about the USAJOBS online application process, go to the[USAJOBs Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help)[.](https://help.usajobs.gov/index.php/Top_Ten_FAQ%c2%a0)

 

**2. If the system only accepts online applications, how do I send other attachments, such as my college transcripts, SF-50's, etc.?**

The best way for you to submit your supporting documents is online. When you upload documents to USAJOBS, you will have electronic versions of your documents ready to go for any online applications. Getting electronic versions of your documents is a ‘create once, use many’ approach! When you decide to apply, you can immediately verify the document is included correctly with your application package to ensure your application is complete. Click the link below for a[guide to help you take a few easy steps to convert your paper supporting document to a reusable electronic file](https://help.usastaffing.gov/Apply/index.php?title=Submitting_a_paper_supporting_document).

 

**3. Since the system will rate me according to my self-assessment and response to the questions, what prevents me from selecting those choices that give me the highest scores?**

Nothing will prevent you from doing this. However, falsifying or answering questions to mislead the system's automated process is no different than providing false or misleading information on your application under the old process. Applicants are reminded that this is a federal job application system. Providing false information, creating fake ID's or SSN's, or failing to answer all questions truthfully and completely may be grounds for not hiring you, for disbarment from federal service, or for dismissal after being hired. Falsifying a federal job application, attempting to violate the privacy of others, or attempting to compromise this system is punishable by fine or imprisonment (U.S. Code, Title 18, section 1001).

 

**4.****Is there any way I can see which positions I have applied for or find out the status of these vacancies?**

To verify the status of your application, log into your USAJOBS account (https://my.usajobs.gov/Account/Login), all of your applications will display on the Welcome screen. The Application Status will display along with the date your application was last updated.[For information on what each Application Status means](https://www.usajobs.gov/Help/how-to/application/status/).

To view details about your application,[obtain a printable version of your application and materials, and review any notifications sent to you about the job, use these instructions](https://help.usastaffing.gov/Apply/index.php?title=Reviewing_your_application_status).

 

### D. Questions and Answers for Managers and Supervisors

**1. How will USA Staffing impact me as a Hiring Manager and/or Subject Matter Expert (SME)?****A:**

As the hiring manager, the role you play in selecting talent is critical to creating the workforce that enables our mission. You are valued as the subject matter expert who knows the knowledge, skills, and abilities a position requires. You will work with HR Specialists at various steps in the recruitment process as identified in agency and/or bureau policy and procedures.

 

**2. I understand that the system is based on applicants' self-certifying their responses to the questions. How do I verify that they are answered honestly and that I receive quality candidates?**

Applicants will be reminded in the vacancy announcement about the penalties for providing false or misleading information. Additionally, the Human Resources Specialist will conduct a quality review on the top rated applicants prior to issuing the certificate to the hiring manager. The quality review will be a comparison of the applicant's responses to the questions and the applicant's resumé. Human Resources Specialists can also request any additional information, e.g., college transcripts, SF-50's and verification of veterans' preference. The true test is during the interview process with the applicant. Hiring managers should ensure that the interview process is used to ask clarifying questions and to do a reference check on potential hires.

 

**3. How do I access USA Staffing as a Hiring Manager?**

Hiring Managers may use USA Staffing to review vacancy announcements and make selections. The system administrator for your organization will create an account and you will receive an email with login instructions. For vacancy announcements in which you are hiring manager, the HR Specialist will notify you when the certificate is ready for review and selection.

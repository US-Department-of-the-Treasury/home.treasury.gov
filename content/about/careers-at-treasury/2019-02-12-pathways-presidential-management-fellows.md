### Pathways Presidential Management Fellows Program

The Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) Program was re-vamped in the  Pathways regulations. This OPM-run program is designed to provide highly educated candidates to managers for further development.  The updated regulations created greater flexibility for managers to use alternate forms of training to meet the 80 hour requirement, and gave managers additional flexibility for conversion.

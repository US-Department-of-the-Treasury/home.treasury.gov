The Treasury Building was the first home of the Bureau of Engraving & Printing and that legacy continues with displays of some of their most significant works. Examples of printers' and engravers' historic works, as well as artist models for currency specimens and certificates, are exhibited throughout the Treasury Building. Of particular interest to collectors are late 19th and early 20th-century currency, stamp and bond displays which were assembled by the Bureau for world fairs and exhibitions. Several of the decorative display frames are on public view along the building corridors as part of the[Saturday Treasury public tour program](https://home.treasury.gov/services/tours-and-library/tours-of-the-historic-treasury-building)(reservations must be made in advance through a Congressional office).

- ### Columbian Display FramesThe pair of Columbian Display frames are the most ornate in Treasury's collection. The history of their production for the 1893 Columbian World's Exposition to their restoration for display in the West Lobby in the 1990's is as colorful as their composition.

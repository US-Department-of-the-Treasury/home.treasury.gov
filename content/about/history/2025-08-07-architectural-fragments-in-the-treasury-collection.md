The Treasury Building has evolved through a number of additions and alterations. Over the course of its development, the building has amassed a variety of architectural fragments that now constitute a diverse study collection. Examples include sections of vaults, structural and decorative iron work fragments, plaster work and hardware. The architectural fragment collection was expanded significantly during a comprehensive restoration and modernization project of the Treasury Building from 1997 to 2007.

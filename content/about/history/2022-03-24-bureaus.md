### Bureaus

 

On November 25, 2002, President Bush signed the Homeland Security Bill which set into motion many changes for the Department of the Treasury. Under the reorganization of the Department, two of Treasury's oldest bureaus, the U.S. Customs Service (1789) and the U.S. Secret Service (1865), as well as the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (1970) were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security on March 1, 2003. Portions of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (1972) were transferred to the Department of Justice on January 24, 2003.

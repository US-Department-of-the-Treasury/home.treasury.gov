The Treasury Collection represents one of the oldest and most intact collections of fine and decorative arts, furniture, and architectural fragments in the Executive branch of the United States government.

Like its immediate neighbor, the White House, the Treasury Department has remained on the original Pennsylvania Avenue site since 1800. The Treasury Collection encompasses items from the main Treasury Building and the Department bureaus.

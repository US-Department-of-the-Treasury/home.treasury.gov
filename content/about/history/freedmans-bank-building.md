## Freedman's Bank Building

The Freedman's Savings and Trust Company, commonly known as the Freedman's Bank, holds a significant place in American financial history and in the legacy of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

### History of the Freedman's Bank

#### Establishment
The Freedman's Savings and Trust Company was established by an Act of Congress on March 3, 1865, to provide banking services to formerly enslaved African Americans following the Civil War.

#### Mission
The bank was created to:
- Encourage savings among freed people
- Provide secure banking services
- Promote financial independence
- Support economic empowerment

#### Growth
At its peak, the Freedman's Bank had:
- 37 branches across the United States
- Over 70,000 depositors
- Deposits exceeding $3 million

### The Building

The Freedman's Bank headquarters was located in Washington, D.C. The building served as the central office for the bank's operations and became a symbol of African American economic progress during Reconstruction.

### Legacy

#### Collapse
Unfortunately, due to mismanagement and the Panic of 1873, the bank failed in 1874, causing significant losses for its depositors.

#### Treasury Connection
Following the bank's failure, Congress established a commission to handle the bank's affairs. The records of the Freedman's Bank were eventually transferred to the National Archives and are now an invaluable resource for genealogical research.

#### Modern Recognition
The Freedman's Bank records contain information on:
- Account holders' names and family histories
- Birth places and former enslavers
- Military service records
- Valuable genealogical data for African American families

## Tax Relief for Working Families

The U.S. Department of the Treasury is committed to providing tax relief that supports working families across America.

### Key Tax Benefits for Families

#### Child Tax Credit
The Child Tax Credit provides significant financial support to families with qualifying children. This credit helps offset the costs of raising children and provides direct financial assistance to eligible families.

#### Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
The Earned Income Tax Credit is a refundable tax credit for low- to moderate-income working individuals and families. It reduces the amount of tax owed and may result in a refund.

#### Child and Dependent Care Credit
This credit helps working families offset the cost of childcare, enabling parents to work or look for work while ensuring their children are properly cared for.

### How to Claim Your Benefits

1. **File Your Tax Return**: All tax credits require filing a federal income tax return
2. **Gather Required Documentation**: Have Social Security numbers and income documentation ready
3. **Use Free Filing Options**: [IRS Free File](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free) is available for eligible taxpayers
4. **Get Help If Needed**: Free tax preparation assistance is available through [VITA](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/free-tax-return-preparation-for-qualifying-taxpayers)

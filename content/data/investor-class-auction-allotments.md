## Investor Class Auction Allotments

The U.S. Department of the Treasury publishes data on auction allotments by investor class for Treasury securities.

### Understanding Auction Data

Treasury auctions result in purchases by three main investor classes:

#### Primary Dealers
- Financial institutions with direct trading relationships with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
- Required to participate in Treasury auctions
- Act as market makers for Treasury securities

#### Direct Bidders
- Investors who bid directly in auctions (not through a dealer)
- Include investment funds, insurance companies, and other institutions
- Bid for their own accounts

#### Indirect Bidders
- Investors who bid through primary dealers
- Include foreign central banks and other international investors
- Often used as a proxy for foreign demand

### Auction Results

For each auction, Treasury reports:
- Total amount offered and accepted
- High, low, and median accepted yields
- Bid-to-cover ratio
- Allocation percentages by investor class

### Data Availability

Auction results are published:
- Immediately after each auction
- Through TreasuryDirect announcements
- In historical auction databases

### Securities Auctioned

Treasury auctions various securities:
- Treasury Bills (4, 8, 13, 17, 26, 52 weeks)
- Treasury Notes (2, 3, 5, 7, 10 years)
- Treasury Bonds (20, 30 years)
- Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)

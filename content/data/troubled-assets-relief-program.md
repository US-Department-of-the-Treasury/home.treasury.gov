Treasury established several programs under TARP to help stabilize the U.S. financial system, restart economic growth, and prevent avoidable foreclosures.

Although Congress initially authorized $700 billion for TARP in October 2008, that authority was reduced to $475 billion by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Of that, the following amounts were committed through TARP's five program areas:

- Approximately $250 billion was committed in programs to stabilize banking institutions ($5 billion of which was ultimately cancelled).
- Approximately $27 billion was committed through programs to restart credit markets.
- Approximately $82 billion was committed to stabilize the U.S. auto industry ($2 billion of which was ultimately cancelled).
- Approximately $70 billion was committed to stabilize American International Group (AIG) ($2 billion of which was ultimately cancelled).
- Approximately $46 billion was committed for programs to help struggling families avoid foreclosure, with these expenditures being made over time.

The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 established OFS within the Office of Domestic Finance at the Department of the Treasury to implement TARP. OFS was not envisioned as a permanent organization. The authority to make new commitments through TARP ended October 3, 2010, at which time Treasury shifted focus to the orderly wind-down of TARP. As of September 30, 2023, all TARP programs have closed, and there are no remaining troubled assets held by OFS. During fiscal year 2023, OFS completed the wind down of its remaining housing programs under TARP and sold its last troubled assets from the Capital Purchase Program and Community Development Capital Initiative. This will be the last set of financial statements produced for TARP as there is no longer a legal requirement to produce future financial statements (12 U.S.C. § 5226(e)). OFS is also dissolving as an entity with only administrative functions remaining. Under the direction of Treasury, OFS will use fiscal year 2024 appropriations to carry out these administrative functions and completely wind down the entity. Further, Treasury will continue to monitor TARP’s Fund Balance with Treasury until the funding is transferred to the General Fund.

As of September 30, 2023, the total amount disbursed for TARP programs was $443.5 billion and OFS collected $425.5 billion (or $443.1 billion if including the $17.5 billion in proceeds from the additional Treasury American International Group, Inc. [AIG] shares) through repayments, sales, dividends, interest, and other income. After considering the interest expense of $13.1 billion, the net cost of TARP programs was $31.1 billion.

1 This table shows TARP activity for the period from inception through September 30, 2023, on a cash basis. Received from investments includes dividends and interest income reported in the Statement of Net Cost, and Proceeds from sale and repurchases of assets in excess of costs.
2 OFS received $31.9 billion in proceeds from sales of Citigroup common stock, of which $25.0 billion is included at cost in Investment Repayments, and $6.9 billion of net proceeds in excess of cost is included in Received from Investments.
3 The amounts for AIG reflect only the operations of TARP and do not reflect proceeds received from the sale of shares of AIG common stock held by Treasury outside of TARP (additional Treasury shares).
4 Losses represent proceeds less than cost on sales of assets, which are reflected under “net proceeds from sales and repurchases of assets in excess of (less than) cost” in Note 6 of the financial statements.
Table 2 provides information on how OFS’s ultimate lifetime cost of TARP has changed over time.

## Corporate Bond Yield Curve

The U.S. Department of the Treasury publishes a corporate bond yield curve used for defined benefit pension plan funding calculations required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

### Purpose

The corporate bond yield curve is used to:
- Calculate present values of pension liabilities
- Determine minimum funding requirements
- Calculate maximum deductible contributions
- Compute lump sum distributions

### Methodology

The yield curve is based on:
- High-quality corporate bonds (rated AAA, AA, or A)
- Bonds from the corporate bond market
- Consistent methodology across maturities
- Monthly updates

### Segment Rates

The yield curve produces three segment rates for pension funding:

| Segment | Maturity Range | Application |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| First | 0-5 years | Short-term liabilities |
| Second | 5-20 years | Medium-term liabilities |
| Third | 20+ years | Long-term liabilities |

### 24-Month Average

For pension funding, the IRS publishes:
- Monthly spot rates
- 24-month average segment rates
- Corridor limitations

### Historical Rates

Historical corporate bond yield curve data enables:
- Trend analysis
- Funding projection
- Actuarial calculations

### Updates

New rates are published monthly by:
- The IRS in guidance notices
- Treasury announcements
- Actuarial publications

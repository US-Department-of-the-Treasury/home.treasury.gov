REVISIONS and RELEASE DATES:

Monthly Press Release of monthly data on Securities & Banking.

Monthly data (a) on transactions in, and holdings of, long-term securities, and (b) on banking & all other financial company claims and liabilities, are updated each month on the 11th business day plus 0 to 3 days. Beginning with the release on 3-15-2021, there is a 1.5 month lag between the release date and the as-of date for the data. (Before the release on 3-15-2021, there was a 1.5 month lag for the holdings data on Treasury securities and a 2.5 month lag for the holdings data on all other securities.) For the securities holdings data the first releases were May, July, September and December of 2012 before monthly releases began in March 2013. Beginning September 16, 2014, the monthly Treasury International Capital (TIC) data are released at 4:00 PM Eastern time. Previously, the release time was normally at 09:00 a.m. in Washington D.C. NOTE that these data series are available on the TIC Homepage from lines 1, 2.a, 2.b, and 3.

Notes on Revisions of monthly and quarterly data:

(c) The January, April, July, and October releases reflect revised data for the past year. For significant revisions, the release will reflect revised data beyond the past year. All other releases reflect revised data for the prior 3 months.

(d) The monthly table showing Major Foreign Holders of U.S. Treasury Securities is available on the TIC Homepage from line 2.b. Beginning December 2011, the data are based on the monthly Form SLT data, and revised as described in (c) above. Before September 2011, revised data back to the previous June was usually released in March to include preliminary data from the annual survey of foreign holdings of U.S. securities at end-June of the previous year. The May release usually included the final results from that survey.

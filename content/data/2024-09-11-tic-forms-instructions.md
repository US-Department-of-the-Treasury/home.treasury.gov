This revision is effective for quarterly reports as-of December 2022 and afterwards.

7. **(03-12-2021)**. The TIC Web site has been redesigned slightly and activated this past week. We invite users to inform us of any missing or broken links.-- Update your Bookmarks. If you use a bookmark in your browser to go to a certain webpage, you will open a redirect-page that says something like "this page has been moved". Clicking on the word "moved" will take you to the new webpage. Then you can change your bookmark to go to the new url location.-- The new webpages are exactly like the previous ones, except: (a) the text is larger so more scrolling will be required; (b) the grey help-bar across the top of each previous-page has been renamed "Contact TIC & Help for Data Filers", and moved into the left-hand column, under the section name "TIC Forms and Instructions". IF YOU CANNOT SEE THE LEFT-HAND COLUMN, try widening the window on your browser screen until you see the column.
8. The list of selected Foreign Official Institutions (FOI list) for use on all TIC reports was changed, effective August 2014. The Only change is the removal of Banco do Brasil, under Brazil. The list is on column B1 on the[foihome](https://treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/foihome.aspx)webpage. (Posted 08-06-2014)

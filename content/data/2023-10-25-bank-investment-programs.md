#### Program Purpose and Overview

As of September 30, 2023, all TARP programs have closed. Treasury invested approximately $245 billion across five distinct bank programs. Each of these programs was established to accomplish different goals as part of the overall effort to stabilize America's banking system. ​Treasury recovered an amount that was greater than what was invested in banks under TARP. Taxpayers began to see a positive return on their bank investments in March 2011. Every additional dollar that was recovered from TARP's bank investments represents an additional return for the taxpayers.

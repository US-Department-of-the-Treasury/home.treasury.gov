6. TIC webpages use 6 types of files.(1) Most webpages contain txt, txt(tab-delimited), CSV, html and PDF files for readers and spreadsheet users. Spreadsheet programs open CSV and html files very easily. Both database and spreadsheet programs open txt(tab-delimited) files easily. No excel or other spreadsheet files are used to avoid spreading computer viruses and other malware.(2) The securities(c) webpage for the annual securities reports contains some MHT files that can be downloaded and then opened with a spreadsheet program. The resulting spreadsheet has many pages; whereas CSV and txt(tab-delimited) files can contain only one.
7. [TIC Glossary, March 2018 version.](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/ticglossary-2018march.pdf)The older glossaries for all Treasury International Capital (“TIC”) reports are consolidated into this separate Glossary document, providing more consistency across the TIC system.

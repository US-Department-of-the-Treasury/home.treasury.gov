**Coraopolis**– Today U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin traveled with President Trump to the H&K Equipment Company in Pennsylvania.  The President spoke to an enthusiastic audience about the benefits of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, signed into law last month.

“The overwhelming reception the President received today reflects the growing optimism we see across the country as a result of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act,” said Secretary Mnuchin.  “We worked so hard to pass significant tax reform for American small businesses and workers like the ones we met with today in Western Pennsylvania.  It is exciting to see firsthand how tax reform is making a positive impact on so many people.”

The President’s speech follows announcements by many employers, including PNC Financial Services and Comcast, that they are passing the benefits of tax reform on to their employees.  Secretary Mnuchin applauds these steps, which will lead to a more secure future for hardworking families.

**Washington** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today proposed repealing 298 tax regulations that are unnecessary, duplicative or obsolete and force taxpayers to navigate needlessly complex or confusing rules. President Trump issued an Executive Order on April 21, 2017, directing Treasury to review tax regulations to ensure a simple, fair, efficient, and pro-growth tax system. Today’s actions are a direct result of that review.

“We continue our work to ensure that our tax regulatory system promotes economic growth,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “These 298 regulations serve no useful purpose to taxpayers and we have proposed eliminating them.  I look forward to continuing to build on our efforts to make the regulatory system more efficient and effective.”

The regulations proposed to be repealed fall into three categories:

1. Regulations interpreting provisions of the Code that have been repealed;
2. Regulations interpreting provisions that have been significantly revised and the existing regulations do not account for these revisions; and
3. Regulations that are no longer applicable.

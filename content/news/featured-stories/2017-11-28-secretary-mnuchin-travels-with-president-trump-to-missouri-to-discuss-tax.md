**St. Charles**—On November 28, 2017, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin traveled with President Trump to St. Charles, Missouri to promote the Administration and Congress’ initiative to cut taxes for middle-income families and businesses.  There the President delivered remarks entitled “Bring Back Main Street.”

“Today the President returned to Missouri to speak to hardworking men and women and small business owners, who are the engines of job creation in our country, about how tax cuts and reform will bring better-paying jobs to Main Street in America,” Secretary Mnuchin said.  “We have the highest business tax rates in the developed world, and they have driven jobs and opportunities overseas.  That is why we are working with Congress to pass historic tax reform that will not only cut taxes for families, it will make our businesses more competitive and spur sustained economic growth that will benefit all Americans,” he continued.

The event took place at the St. Charles Convention Center.

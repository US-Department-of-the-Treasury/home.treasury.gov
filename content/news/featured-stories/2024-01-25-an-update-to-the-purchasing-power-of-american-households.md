Last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that median weekly real earnings—that is, the typical American worker’s earnings adjusted for inflation—rose briskly in the fourth quarter of last year: by 1.4 percent, or 5.6 percent at an annual rate.  This robust increase means a further increase in purchasing power for the median worker and is good news for American households.

We incorporated the new earnings data, along with consumer price data through the fourth quarter, into an update of[our December blog post](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-purchasing-power-of-american-households)on the purchasing power of American households.  The new data strengthened the argument that income has risen more than prices since before the pandemic: the typical middle-class worker has seen their real weekly earnings rise 2.4 percent since 2019.[[1]](#ftn1)**We now find that as of the end of 2023, the median American worker could afford the same goods and services as they did in 2019, with an additional $1,400 to spend or save per year.** These results suggest that households are doing even better than our previous estimate of a $1,000 gain in purchasing power, which was based on data through the third quarter of 2023.

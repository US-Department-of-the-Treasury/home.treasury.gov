WASHINGTON – Over the next two weeks, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson and Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg will travel to Central Europe and Central Asia, respectively, to continue the Treasury Department’s work countering sanctions evasion and combatting Russia’s ability to supply its war against Ukraine.

From the beginning of Russia’s illegal invasion, the sanctions and export controls imposed by a coalition of more than 30 countries representing over half of the world’s GDP have been in furtherance of two goals: denying Russia the inputs and equipment it needs on the battlefield and limiting the revenue the Kremlin is relying on to fund its war.

The Kremlin has been actively seeking ways to circumvent sanctions, tasking its intelligence services with finding ways to circumvent them. In partnership with the Department of Commerce, other U.S. government departments and agencies, and our international coalition, the Treasury Department is outlining the clear business decision at hand: remain connected to the global economy or provide material support to Russia’s war and be denied access to the world’s most important markets.

Following this week’s[major designations](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1402)targeting sanctions evasion networks and facilitators in over 20 countries and jurisdictions, Under Secretary Nelson and Assistant Secretary Rosenberg will use these trips to seek ways to collaborate more closely, share information, and discuss trade trends and enforcement priorities at all levels of the supply chain.

In Central Europe, Under Secretary Nelson will meet with government officials, financial institutions and other businesses that have continued exposure to Russia, and manufacturers and participants in key industries.

### Under Secretary Nelson’s Schedule

April 16 – 18: Zurich and Bern, Switzerland

April 19: Milan, Italy

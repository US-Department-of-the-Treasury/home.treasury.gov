The U.S. Department of the Treasury would like to recognize Mr. Corvelli McDaniel and Dr. Lorraine Cole who, together, have promoted inclusivity in financial institutions through their establishment of the Treasury Bank Mentor Protégé Program. They have been awarded the Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal, an honor given to those who exhibit a profound dedication to public policy in civil service.

The Treasury Bank Mentor Protégé Program pairs larger banks with smaller, minority-owned banks that often serve low-income communities. Commercial banking entities have the resources and platform to help position smaller institutions for growth and opportunities. The program continues to expand and thrive throughout COVID-19, as minority banks have been providing loans to their communities in large numbers. Its accomplishments have garnered the acknowledgement of Members of Congress.

Mr. McDaniel is the Assistant Commissioner for Revenue Collections Management in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Dr. Cole is the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer at Main Treasury. The U.S. Department of the Treasury congratulates them on this significant achievement.

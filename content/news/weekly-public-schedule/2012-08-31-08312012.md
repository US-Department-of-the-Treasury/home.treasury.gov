**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced today that Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen will travel to Switzerland and Turkey September 1 – 5, 2012, to discuss newly expanded U.S. sanctions against Iran as well as international efforts to hasten the removal of the Assad regime in Syria.
 
Continuing the Treasury Department's global engagement on national security issues, Under Secretary Cohen will meet with senior government officials and members of the financial sector in Bern and Geneva, Switzerland, and Ankara and Istanbul, Turkey. Under Secretary Cohen will brief senior officials and private sector leaders on the new authorities contained in Executive Order 13622, which expands U.S. sanctions aimed at the Iranian Central Bank and Iran's petrochemical and petroleum sector, including by targeting payments or other material support to the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and the Naftiran Intertrade Company (NICO).
 
Under Secretary Cohen's meetings will also focus on other issues of common interest, including U.S. efforts to work with international partners to synchronize and expand international sanctions against the Assad regime as well as continued global and regional efforts to disrupt the financing of terrorist groups throughout the Middle East.

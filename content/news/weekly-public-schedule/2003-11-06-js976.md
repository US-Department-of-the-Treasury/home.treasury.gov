Director of the Office for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Compliance Policy D. Scott Parsons will be in Boston on Friday, November 7, 2003.  He will participate in a joint public-private sector symposium for representatives of financial institutions on security issues and protecting the financial industry from cyber attack.



�Protecting the Financial Sector and Cyber Security Risk Management � A Public and Private Partnership� will take place from 8:30 am � 4:30 pm.  Mr. Parsons will speak at 8:40 am at Lindsay Hall on the campus of Bentley College in Waltham, Massachusetts.



Sponsored by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the symposium represents an outreach effort by the government�s Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC) and the private sector�s Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council (FSSCC) to private sector financial firms in the Boston metropolitan area.



At the Treasury Department, Mr. Parsons is Director of the Office of Critical Infrastructure Protection, which was established after September 11, 2001 to strengthen the nation�s safeguards against terrorist activities and financial crime.  The Office plays a key role in coordinating public and private efforts to protect the critical infrastructure of the financial services industry from attack.

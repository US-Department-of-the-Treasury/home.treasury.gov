The Treasury Department in 2002 established the Office of Financial Education to strengthen the financial literacy of all Americans, and provide guidance to organizations providing financial education programs. The Office works to ensure that people can gain the practical knowledge and skills necessary to make informed financial choices throughout various life stages. It focuses on four key areas: basic savings, credit management, homeownership and retirement planning.

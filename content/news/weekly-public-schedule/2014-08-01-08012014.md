Committee to Meet on August 7



**WASHINGTON **– The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the appointment of 21 individuals to serve as members of the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance (FACI or Committee).The FACI provides advice to the Federal Insurance Office (FIO) on issues related to the responsibilities and authorities of the office.



“The Committee members are recognized leaders and represent much of the vast diversity within the U.S. insurance sector,” said Michael McRaith, Director of the FIO.  “We are excited to receive the benefit of their expertise and perspective on the many important issues in which Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office is involved.”



FIO, which was established within Treasury as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, monitors all aspects of the insurance sector, including identifying issues that could contribute to systemic risk in the insurance industry or the U.S. financial system.  It also assesses the availability and affordability of insurance to traditionally underserved populations; advises the Secretary of the Treasury on major domestic insurance policy issues; and develops and coordinates federal policy on prudential aspects of international insurance matters.



Treasury has increased FACI membership from 15 to 21 members to provide more representation of the broad diversity within the insurance sector.  The members of the FACI represent state insurance regulators and other stakeholders, with backgrounds ranging from consumer advocacy and academia to the business of insurance.

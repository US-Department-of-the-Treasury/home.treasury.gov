**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced that Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Adam J. Szubin will visit Beijing, China and Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of China on March 15 and 16, 2016. During his trip, Acting Under Secretary Szubin will meet with senior government officials and private sector compliance officers for discussions on a range of issues of mutual interest. In light of the recent United Nations Security Council Resolution and Treasury and State designations against North Korea this month, this trip provides an important opportunity for discussions of ways to strengthen U.S.-China coordination in response to North Korea’s destabilizing behavior and to ensure sanctions targeting the North Korean regime are as effective as possible.  During the trip, Acting Under Secretary Szubin will also discuss efforts to combat ISIL’s finances; implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and the sanctions that remain in place to target Iran's other malign activities; as well as broader security and counter terrorist financing issues. ###

**WASHINGTON** – On Friday, June 24, Secretary Geithner will travel to Manchester and Hanover, New Hampshire to meet with local business leaders and participate in Dartmouth College’s new lecture series, “Leading Voices in Politics and Policy.” The Secretary’s visit will be an opportunity to hear from New Hampshire business leaders about how to continue to strengthen economic growth and private sector job creation, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. The Secretary will discuss the important role of the manufacturing sector in our economic recovery, in particular how to build on the strength over the last year in high-tech manufacturing, including in areas like semiconductors and clean energy. He will also discuss incentives and policies the Administration is putting in place to spur job growth, especially for small and medium-sized businesses, and how a balanced, credible plan for deficit reduction can strengthen American competitiveness and make room for important investments in our long-term growth. **MANCHESTER****** **WHO:            **Tim Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury   **WHAT:**Brief media availability following meeting with New Hampshire business leaders **WHEN:          **Friday, June 24, 2011   12:00 PM EST **WHERE:       **900 Elm Street   Manchester, NH Media interested in attending the press availability should arrive by 11:45 AM EST.

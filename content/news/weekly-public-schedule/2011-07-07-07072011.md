**WASHINGTON** – On Tuesday, July 12, 2011, the U.S. Department of the Treasury will convene a Women in Finance Symposium focusing on institutional investment. Following up on the first Women in Finance Symposium in March 2010 and Treasury’s Access to Capital Conference earlier this year, the symposium will bring together senior Administration officials, private sector leaders, and institutional investors for a series of panel discussions to recognize a new group of women who have risen to leadership roles in the institutional investment space and to explore the crucial role of the capital they invest in economic growth and sustainability, entrepreneurship, and job creation in America. Tuesday’s symposium will initiate a dialogue on how institutional investors are deploying capital and managing risk and how investment practices have changed post-financial crisis. **WHO:**            Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President Valerie Jarrett Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Markets Mary Miller Treasurer of the United States Rosie Rios Obama Administration officials Prominent institutional investors and private sector leaders **WHAT:**Women in Finance Investment Symposium **WHEN:**Tuesday, July 12, 2011   8:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. ET **WHERE:**       Cash Room U.S. Treasury Department        1500 Pennsylvania Ave., NW   Washington, D.C. 20220 *The event will also be streamed live on www.home.treasury.gov. *   **AGENDA:** **8:30 AM ET** WELCOMING REMARKS Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President Valerie Jarrett OPENING REMARKS Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner **8:50 AM ET** PANEL 1: Adapting and Innovating in the Financial Markets **9:45 AM ET** PANEL 2: Exploring the New Landscape for Asset Managers **11:00 AM ET** PANEL 3: Investing in the Economic Recovery **12:00 PM ET** CLOSING REMARKS SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro **MEDIA NOTES:** *All discussions are open press but space is limited and is first come, first serve.

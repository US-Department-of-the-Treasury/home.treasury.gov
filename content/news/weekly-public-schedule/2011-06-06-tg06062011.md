**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced today that Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen will travel to Japan and South Korea from June 7 – 10 for meetings with senior government officials on Iran. In both countries, Acting Under Secretary Cohen will emphasize the importance of continuing robust implementation of international sanctions to prevent Iran from accessing the international financial system to facilitate its illicit nuclear and weapons program. He will also consult with our partners on next steps to increase pressure by redoubling efforts to target those entities facilitating Iran’s illicit activities, especially Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).​

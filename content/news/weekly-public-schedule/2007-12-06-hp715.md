One area of focus has been the difference between the U.S. financial regulatory structure and regulators around the world, including the benefits of the U.K. financial regulatory structure. Additionally, Treasury has been examining the benefits and consequences of the overlapping federal and state-based oversight on issues such as mortgage origination and insurance. The Department will release its recommendations for improvement early next year.

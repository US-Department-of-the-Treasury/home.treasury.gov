**WASHINGTON **– On Wednesday, March 30, 2016, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew will deliver a major address on the evolution of sanctions and lessons for the future at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  Over the last decade, the United States has refined the use of economic sanctions so that the tool is now used to assert considerable leverage to support allies and pressure bad actors to achieve foreign policy goals.  In his address, Secretary Lew will discuss the evolution of sanctions, outline lessons learned from previous challenges and successes, and raise the importance of guarding against their misuse.  He will also highlight how to further shape the use of sanctions in the future in order to make the world more secure while being ever mindful of their global economic impact.  Carnegie President William J. Burns will moderate the conversation. **WHO**:   U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J.

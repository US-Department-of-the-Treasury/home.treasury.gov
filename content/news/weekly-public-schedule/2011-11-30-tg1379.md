**WASHINGTON** – As part of the Administration’s ongoing work to implement financial reform legislation, the Federal Insurance Office will host a conference, entitled “Insurance Regulation in the United States: Modernization and Improvement” on December 9, 2011 in the Treasury Department’s Cash Room. This conference will bring together state insurance regulators, federal government officials, consumer organizations, representatives of the insurance industry, and insurance experts to have a meaningful exchange on potential areas for insurance regulatory reform.

****UPDATED** TREASURY SECRETARY LEW TO DELIVER REMARKS ON THE DEPARTMENT’S ROLE IN ADVANCING U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY AT THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES**



****Agenda provided below****



**WASHINGTON**– On Monday, June 2, 2014, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew will deliver remarks at a symposium co-hosted by the Treasury Department and the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., entitled “TFI@10: The Evolution of Treasury’s National Security Role.” This event will convene senior Administration officials, former government and Congressional leaders, and other foreign policy experts in academia and the private sector to discuss the future of financial tools, financial transparency, and financial intelligence as a means of advancing our national security. The symposium marks the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence within the Treasury Department and recognizes its important work to disrupt and dismantle the financial networks of terrorist organizations, proliferators of weapons of mass destruction, drug traffickers, and transnational organized criminals as well as to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse.



Since its establishment in 2004, TFI has marshalled the Department’s intelligence, regulatory, policy and enforcement authorities to combat the most significant threats to U.S. national security and advance key foreign policy objectives.

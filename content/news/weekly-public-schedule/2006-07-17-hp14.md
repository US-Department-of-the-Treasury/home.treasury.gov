Iannicola will help teachers integrate financial education into their curricula as part of a one-day conference hosted by the coalition's Alabama chapter.



The Treasury Department and other agencies and departments in the Financial Literacy and Education Commission released a strategy to improve financial literacy in America earlier this year.  The plan, titled Taking Ownership of the Future: The National Strategy for Financial Literacy, is available in English and Spanish at[MyMoney.gov](http://www.mymoney.gov/).

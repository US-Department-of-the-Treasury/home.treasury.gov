​**WASHINGTON –** On Friday, September 19, 2014, Deputy Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin will deliver opening remarks on the need to increase opportunities for upward economic mobility in the U.S. and how public policy should be designed to address the financial and economic challenges facing millions of hard working American families. The Deputy Secretary’s remarks will kick off a public discussion with policymakers, industry experts, and other thought leaders on how we can better serve the needs of American families who are, through no fault of their own, struggling to lift themselves out of poverty, and how challenging it is to handle the financial pressures of living without access to safe and affordable financial products and services.  An important piece of the discussion will be centered on financial products and services and how, if structured correctly, they can better enable American families to save more, build assets, access credit, and achieve financial stability and prosperity.  A panel discussion will follow a screening of the documentary released earlier this year, entitled, Spent: Looking for Change. Executive produced by Davis Guggenheim (An Inconvenient Truth, Waiting for Superman) and directed by Derek Doneen, Spent: Looking for Change follows the stories of four working individuals and families living with limited financial options.  The documentary traces their decisions to turn to costly alternative financial services to maintain their livelihoods.

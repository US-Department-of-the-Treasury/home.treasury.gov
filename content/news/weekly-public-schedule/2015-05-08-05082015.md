TUESDAY: TREASURY HOSTS ANNUAL STATE SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT INITIATIVE CONFERENCE WASHINGTON – On Tuesday May 12, 2015, the U.S. Treasury Department will host its annual State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) conference in Washington D.C. The event will bring together senior officials from the Treasury Department and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, state officials, and industry leaders for a dialogue on the SSBCI program and ways to promote access to capital for small businesses.   SSBCI is an innovative program that awards funds to state agencies for lending and investing programs. The program allows each state to design its own small business support programs in response to local economic conditions. Through SSBCI, the U.S. Treasury Department awarded almost $1.5 billion to 47 states, the District of Columbia, five territories and municipalities in three states to fund programs that support small businesses and small manufacturers. To date, the Treasury Department has disbursed more than $1.1 billion in SSBCI funds to participating states.  This has resulted in more than $6 billion in private lending or investments to small businesses around the country.

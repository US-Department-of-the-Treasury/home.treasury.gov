The U.S. Treasury Department and the American Bankers Association Education Foundation once again are partnering for the 10th annual Teach Children to Save Day on Tuesday, April 25.  Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and nine department officials and staff members will volunteer their time to teach America's elementary and high school students the importance of saving.
 
"The national attention to financial education �highlighted for ten years now by National Teach Children to Save Day � means we have an opportunity to start fresh with a new generation, to ensure tomorrow's young adults understand how important it is to save, and how to protect themselves from identity theft, in the same way they understand the basics of physical health or road safety," Secretary Snow said. "There is also a tremendous interest from high school students to learn the financial facts of life: how to manage a credit card, how to save and invest, and how important it is to save for retirement at the beginning of a career, not at the end. Considering the average American's personal savings rate was negative .5 percent in 2005, it becomes clear we must work to satisfy the natural desire of young people to learn now and reduce this problem for the next generation." 
 
"I'm proud to be participating in National Teach Children to Save Day," he continued. "And I'm proud of the members of the Treasury team who are getting out of the office and into the classroom."
 
Secretary Snow, U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral and Edward L. Yingling, President and CEO of the American Bankers Association, will host ninth-graders from Woodrow Wilson High School in Washington, DC, as they kick off national Teach Children to Save Day with a class at the Treasury Department taught by the officials themselves.  Ten Treasury officials and staff members will teach classes around the country that day.
 
This is Treasury's third year participating in Teach Children to Save Day, when thousands of bankers and Department officials connect with students in classrooms and after-school programs to share "real life" lessons about money.  The Department is a national leader on youth financial education and recently led the launch of the National Strategy for Financial Education, available at [www.mymoney.gov](http://www.mymoney.gov).

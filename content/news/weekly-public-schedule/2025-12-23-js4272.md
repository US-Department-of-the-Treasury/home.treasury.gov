Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will travel to Egypt this weekend to attend the Finance Ministerial of the Broader Middle East and North Africa (BMENA) initiative. The meeting is an opportunity for finance ministers from the region and around the world to review the concrete progress made by the initiative to build stronger economies in the region. 
 
In his discussions, Secretary Snow will focus on issues such as encouraging financial institutions to provide credit to small and medium sized enterprises, spreading best-practice financial sector regulation, and developing country-by-country reform plans for improving investment climates.
 
"I look forward to continuing the beneficial discussions this forum has produced on building economic freedom in the region through market-oriented reforms," said Treasury Secretary Snow.

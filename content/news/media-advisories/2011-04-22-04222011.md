**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced today that Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen will travel to Turkey and France from April 24 – 28 for meetings with senior government officials. While there, he will emphasize the importance of robust implementation of the multilateral sanctions regime on Iran to prevent it from establishing new financial and economic footholds to facilitate its illicit nuclear and weapons program. He will also discuss international efforts to apply maximum pressure on the Qadhafi regime. In Ankara and Istanbul, Acting Under Secretary Cohen will continue Treasury’s global engagement with private sector leaders on the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act (CISADA) to raise awareness that foreign financial institutions that do significant business with individuals or entities designated by the United States will lose access the U.S. financial system.

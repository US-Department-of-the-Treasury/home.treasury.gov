U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will visit Akron, Ohio on Thursday, August 5 and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Friday, August 6 to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs.



"As a result of the President's tax reform and economic policies, more than 1.5 million new U.S. jobs have been created since August 2003, including nearly 1.3 million that were created this year," said Secretary Snow. "So far this year, Pennsylvania has gained more than 59,000 new jobs, while Ohio has gained close to 18,000."



The President's tax reform policies have ensured that more than 4.4 million Ohio taxpayers and more than 4.6 million Pennsylvania taxpayers will have lower income tax bills in 2004.

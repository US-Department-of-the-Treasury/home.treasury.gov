Top Treasury Official to Discuss the President’s Proposals to Grow the Economy, Create Jobs and Strengthen the Middle Class

  

**WASHINGTON –**On Monday, February 25, Acting Treasury Secretary Neal S. Wolin will travel to Chicago, Illinois to discuss the President’s proposals to strengthen the middle class by making America a magnet for jobs and manufacturing, equipping every American with the skills they need to do those jobs and ensuring that hard work leads to a decent living. When combined with the President’s plan for balanced deficit reduction, these investments in manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy, education and job training, will help strengthen and grow our economy from the middle class out.



While in Chicago, Acting Secretary Wolin will deliver remarks at an event hosted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. In addition, he will host a roundtable with local leaders and leading business executives; tour a UPS sorting facility and visit with employees participating in UPS' Chicagoland Regional College Program; and meet with students and educators at Evanston Township High School, his alma mater.

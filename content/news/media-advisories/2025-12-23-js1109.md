Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will visit Charleston, WV on Friday, January 23 to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President’s plan to further strengthen the U.S. economy through job creation.
 
During his visit to Charleston, Secretary Snow will tour a local construction site, an industry that is playing a key role in the growth of the U.S. economy. The Commerce Department this week reported that housing construction continued to increase in December, making 2003 the best year for home builders since 1978.

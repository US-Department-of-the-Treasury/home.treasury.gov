Secretary John W. Snow will travel to New York City January 10-12 to promote President Bush's second-term economic agenda. During three days of meetings with Wall Street leaders, Secretary Snow will discuss a wide array of economic issues while placing special emphasis on President Bush's plan to reform America's Social Security system for future generations.



"One of the tests of leadership is to confront problems before they become a crisis.President Bush came to Washington to solve problems, not pass them on to future Presidents and future generations," Secretary Snow said.



Throughout the week Secretary Snow will discuss the benefits of voluntary personal accounts which, as part of a comprehensive bipartisan solution, will give younger workers the option to save some payroll taxes in a personal account a nest egg they can call their own, government cannot take away, and they can pass on to their children.

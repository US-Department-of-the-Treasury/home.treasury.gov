**WASHINGTON –** On Tuesday May 3, 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department will host its annual State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) conference during National Small Business Week. The event will mark five years of the SSBCI program, and it will bring senior Obama Administration officials, state officials, and industry leaders together for a series of keynotes and panel discussions on ways to promote access to capital for small businesses.  SSBCI is an innovative program that awards funds to local programs that can spur greater levels of private sector lending and investing for small businesses. The program allows each state to design its own small business support programs in response to local economic conditions. Through SSBCI, the U.S. Treasury Department awarded almost $1.5 billion to 47 states, the District of Columbia, five territories and municipalities in three states to fund programs that support small businesses. To date, the Treasury Department has disbursed more than $1.3 billion in SSBCI funds to participating states. States have reported more than $8 billion in private lending or investments to small businesses around the country.   **WHO**:

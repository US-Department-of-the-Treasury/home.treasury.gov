**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced that Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing Daniel L. Glaser will travel to Muscat, Oman; Doha, Qatar; and Moscow, Russia, February 6-10, 2012 to discuss a wide range of issues including the global effort to stem the flow of funding for terrorism and transnational organized crime, the implementation of U.S. sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran, and the need for authorities to remain vigilant against attempts by the Syrian regime to evade international sanctions. In Doha and Muscat, Assistant Secretary Glaser will consult with host governments about recent U.S. and international sanctions taken against Iran, the importance of protecting the international financial system from abuse by terrorist groups, and the increased international pressure necessary to put an end to the needless violence and bloodshed that is taking place in Syria. In Moscow, Assistant Secretary Glaser will meet with senior government officials to brief them on the Administration’s strategy to combat transnational organized crime and to build on ongoing cooperation with Russia to protect the international financial system from the threat posed by transnational criminal organizations. He will also discuss global efforts to increase pressure on the Iranian regime and isolate Iran from the international financial system. ###

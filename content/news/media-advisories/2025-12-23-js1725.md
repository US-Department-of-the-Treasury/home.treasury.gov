Secretary John W. Snow will visit San Francisco and San Jose, California and Las Vegas, Nevada this week to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs.
 
As a result of President Bush's tax policy reforms, 12.4 million taxpayers in California will have lower income tax bills in 2004 and nearly 3.1 million business taxpayers in California can use their tax savings to invest in new equipment, hire additional workers, and increase pay. In Nevada, 845,000 taxpayers will have lower income tax bills and more than 160,000 businesses will benefit in 2004.

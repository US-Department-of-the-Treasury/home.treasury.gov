Today, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo met virtually with CEOs from seven U.S.-based payment companies and representatives from the Payments Leadership Council (PLC) to discuss the important role electronic payments and financial inclusion play in our economic recovery.  Deputy Secretary Adeyemo reiterated how critical it is that businesses and government work together toward a swift and inclusive economic recovery. In particular, Adeyemo stressed that the recovery must address the economic inequalities that existed before, but have been exacerbated by, the pandemic.

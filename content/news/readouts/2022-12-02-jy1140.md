WASHINGTON - Earlier today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. Secretary Yellen expressed her appreciation for Minister Le Maire and France’s close cooperation on actions that will deprive the Kremlin of revenues it needs to wage its illegal war on Ukraine.  Secretary Yellen affirmed the shared commitment to a strong partnership on energy security; climate ambition; global taxation; and resilient, reliable supply chains, including with other European partners.

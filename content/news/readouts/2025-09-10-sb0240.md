**WASHINGTON **— On September 8–9, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Mexico’s Secretaría de Hacienda y Crédito Público convened senior representatives from the U.S. and Mexican public and private sectors for the 20th U.S.-Mexico Banking Dialogue (UMBD).

In line with President Trump’s directive to end the threat of drug trafficking organizations (DTOs), the event focused on sharpening efforts by the U.S. and Mexican public and private sectors to disrupt the illicit financial activity of Mexico-based DTOs, and the networks that enable them. The event reinforced the close and longstanding partnership between the United States and Mexico to safeguard our financial systems from cross-border illicit finance threats.

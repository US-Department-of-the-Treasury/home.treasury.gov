WASHINGTON - U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met yesterday with Indonesia Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan. They discussed the potential for an accelerated transition away from coal in Indonesia’s power sector as well as the potential for a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), a model that aims to aggregate donor country, multilateral development bank, philanthropic, and private sector resources to support that transition. Through a JETP, Indonesia and an international partnership group would work to speed coal-fired generation decommissioning and expedite the deployment of renewable energy while also supporting those workers and communities who are most vulnerable to the energy transition.

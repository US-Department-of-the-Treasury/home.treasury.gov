WASHINGTON — Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo attended a virtual roundtable discussion focused on LGBTQ+ economic inclusion, hosted by global LGBTQ+ business network Out Leadership. The Deputy Secretary underscored Treasury’s commitment to using its tools and global voice to advance equity, particularly toward an equitable economic recovery. The Deputy Secretary and business leaders discussed the importance of employment non-discrimination, supplier diversity, representation of LGBTQ+ people on corporate boards, and the role of the private sector in reducing barriers for LGBTQ+ individuals and business owners. The Deputy Secretary sought feedback on how Treasury can reach communities that have historically been left behind, including the LGBTQ+ community, and how major companies are planning for the return of employees to the office.

WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with the US-China Business Council’s Board of Directors to discuss the U.S.-China economic relationship. Secretary Yellen recognized the importance of trade and investment with China, given deep integration between the two economies, while acknowledging concerns around barriers to market access and its use of non-market tools. She also reaffirmed the U.S. economic approach to China, which remains focused on three primary objectives: securing vital interests pertaining to national security and human rights; pursuing healthy and mutually beneficial economic competition, in which China plays by international rules; and seeking bilateral cooperation on urgent global challenges, including on the macroeconomy, climate, and global debt.

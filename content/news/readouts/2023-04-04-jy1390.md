LAS VEGAS – U.S. Treasurer Chief Lynn Malerba today spoke at the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development’s (NCAIED) 2023 Reservation Economic Summit (RES). During her remarks, Chief Malerba detailed initiatives the Treasury Department has undertaken to strengthen nation-to-nation relations with Tribal governments, including standing up Treasury’s first ever Office of Tribal and Native Affairs (OTNA), which serves as an important bridge to ensure policies consider and meet the needs of Tribal citizens.

Following her remarks, Chief Malerba led a panel discussion with senior officials from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and the U.S. Department of Commerce on Biden-Harris Administration initiatives to increase access to capital for Tribal communities. To elevate the voices of Native Americans in the Administration, in his first year in office, President Biden restored the White House Council on Native American Affairs (WHCNAA) which has helped foster an all-of-government approach to working on Tribal issues. This includes the Access to Capital Initiative, established by WHCNAA and a multi-agency team including the Treasury Department, which aims to increase the awareness, access, and utilization of financing opportunities for Tribal nations.

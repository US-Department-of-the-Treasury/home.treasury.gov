WASHINGTON — Today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with Germany’s Minister of Finance Christian Lindner on the sidelines of the 2024 Spring Meetings hosted by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. Secretary Yellen reiterated the Administration’s ongoing efforts to secure vital military assistance and direct budget support for Ukraine and underscored the importance of the House of Representatives acting as quickly as possible. Secretary Yellen also discussed ways to unlock the value of immobilized Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s continued resistance and long-term reconstruction, and ways to constrain Russia’s access to the goods it needs to build weapons, including the role China plays in supplying Russia’s military industrial complex.  Secretary Yellen also addressed the Iranian regime’s attack on Israel, affirming that the Treasury Department would not hesitate to work with its allies to use its economic tools to continue disrupting the regime’s malign and destabilizing activity.

WASHNGTON - Earlier tonight, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen spoke with Japan Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki.  Secretary Yellen pledged to work closely with Japan, and with the G7, to isolate Russia from the global financial system in light of its unprovoked invasion towards Ukraine.  Secretary Yellen highlighted the force of the unprecedented and coordinated measures from the U.S. and its partners and allies, including Japan, and welcomed Japan’s recent action towards the Central Bank of Russia and intention to take action against Belarus.  Both the U.S. and Japan committed to continue their close coordination on actions moving forward to impose maximum costs on Russia.

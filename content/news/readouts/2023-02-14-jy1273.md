WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo led a roundtable discussion with nearly 20 stakeholders on IRS efforts to use resources provided by the Inflation Reduction Act to upgrade customer service for small businesses.

During the conversation, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo highlighted how improvements to customer service on the phone, online, and in-person will benefit small business owners, ensuring small business owners file accurate returns that are processed more quickly, and that they are able to access credits and benefits for which they are eligible in a timely manner. He also discussed ways in which a better-resourced IRS can make the tax code fairer by ensuring wealthy Americans and large corporations can’t evade the taxes they owe.

The Deputy Secretary and national advocates were joined by U.S. Treasury officials, including Chief Implementation Officer Laurel Blatchford.

Today’s roundtable was part of an ongoing series of convenings the Deputy Secretary has held since the IRA was passed in August. In addition to hearing from small business owners and advocates, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo has also convened roundtables with labor leaders, climate change organizations, renewable energy investors, and civil rights leaders.

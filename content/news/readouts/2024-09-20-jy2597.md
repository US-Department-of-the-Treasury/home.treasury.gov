WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen convened a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) in executive session by videoconference.

During the meeting, the Council received an update from Treasury staff on key themes in an upcoming staff progress report by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance. Council members discussed recent and ongoing efforts by Council member agencies to enhance the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market.

The Council also received an update from the Council’s Climate-related Financial Risk Committee on progress over the last year on the development of risk indicators and narrative analyses to monitor climate-related financial risks.

WASHINGTON - On Thursday, September 15, Climate Counselor to the Secretary of the Treasury John Morton and Deputy Special Envoy for Climate Rick Duke concluded a visit to Jakarta, Indonesia, where they met with Indonesian counterparts to advance the development of the Indonesia Just Energy Transition Partnership.  This Partnership seeks to aggregate finance from partner governments with private sector finance to accelerate Indonesia’s transition to a cleaner energy future. Alongside Japanese partners, the Treasury and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate (SPEC) delegation discussed Indonesia’s continued efforts to develop and implement an ambitious strategy to significantly reduce emissions in its power sector, including by transitioning away from coal and towards renewables and implementing key reforms that will allow for significant private investment in the renewable energy market. The delegation emphasized that the United States, Japan, and other donor country partners are prepared to support such a strategy with significant amounts of financial support.  The delegation was encouraged by the Indonesians’ commitment to realize a transition that drives jobs and innovation, while being just and equitable for those most vulnerable to the transition.  In addition to meetings with Government of Indonesia officials, the delegation held meetings with multilateral development bank representatives, renewable energy developers, and civil society organizations.

**WASHINGTON** – Last week, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent met with Canadian Minister of Finance and National Revenue Francois-Philippe Champagne to encourage Canada to further engage on outstanding U.S. trade concerns, including imbalances in auto trade.

Secretary Bessent also emphasized the Administration’s expectation that Canada, alongside Europe and the UK, increases economic pressure on Russia through coordinated G7 efforts. The Secretary also emphasized the need for a unified response towards China’s global rare earth export controls, and the importance of diversified supply chains.

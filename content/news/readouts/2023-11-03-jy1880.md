WASHINGTON -- On October 30, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson spoke with Bahrain’s Ambassador Nancy Abdullah Jamal, Chief of Strategic Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and representative to the Executive Committee of the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center (TFTC). Under Secretary Nelson and Ambassador Jamal discussed the importance of working in close collaboration to disrupt the flow of funding to terrorist groups and destabilizing actors across the region.  They also affirmed the key role of the TFTC in protecting the international financial system, particularly through facilitating the sharing of lead information among members and through taking joint actions—public and private—to address terrorist threats.

Under Secretary Nelson emphasized Treasury’s commitment to working with Bahrain and other TFTC members to jointly counter threats posed by other destabilizing regional actors who seek to exploit the situation on the ground.  This follows his travel last week to the Middle East, where he co-chaired an[emergency meeting of the TFTC’s Executive Committee](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1836#:~:text=Inaction%20only%20enables%20instability.,jurisdictions%2C%20but%20also%20human%20life.)in the wake of Hamas’s attack on Israel.

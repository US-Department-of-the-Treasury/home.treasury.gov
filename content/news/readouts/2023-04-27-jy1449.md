WASHINGTON – Today, ahead of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) Heritage Month, Chief Recovery Officer Jacob Leibenluft and Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program Director Verónica Soto convened a virtual roundtable of tenants and local and national organizations to discuss the impact the American Rescue Plan’s (ARP) ERA program has made on Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Native Hawaiian renters and communities.

ERA programs have made nearly[10.8 million household payments](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1358)to families at risk of eviction, and the Treasury Department has reallocated[over $4.8 billion of funds](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1408)that may have otherwise gone unused, ensuring rapid deployment of resources to millions of families across the country.

During the roundtable, tenants shared how they have benefited from ERA-funded programs and initiatives in their respective communities. Tenants and organizations also discussed ways to continue reducing barriers to accessing affordable housing services and best practices for keeping people in their homes.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen convened a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) in executive and public sessions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury).

During the executive session, the Council discussed recent market developments, including current conditions in the banking sector.  The Council noted that the U.S. banking system remains sound and resilient, and several Council members reported on their agencies’ continued monitoring of the banking sector and efforts to assess the impact of current conditions on other financial markets and institutions.

The Council also received an update from Treasury staff on work by the Council’s Hedge Fund Working Group, its assessment of hedge fund-related financial stability risks, and its analysis of hedge fund activities in the non-centrally cleared bilateral repurchase agreement market.

In addition, the Council heard a presentation from staff of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Federal Reserve, and Ginnie Mae on work of the Council’s Nonbank Mortgage Servicing Task Force.  The presentation included the Task Force’s analysis of financial stability risks related to nonbank mortgage servicers.

The Council also discussed its proposed analytic framework for financial stability risk identification, assessment, and response, and the Council’s proposed interpretive guidance regarding nonbank financial company designations.

Today Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo and White House American Rescue Plan Coordinator Gene Sperling convened a meeting with faith leaders representing a diverse set of congregations and faith-based nonprofits from across the country to discuss efforts to raise awareness about resources included in the American Rescue Plan. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo and Mr. Sperling thanked the leaders for the work they’ve done to help people in their congregations and communities know about resources like the Child Tax Credit and Emergency Rental Assistance and how to sign up. They shared that one of the key learnings from the first six months of implementing these programs has been the importance of trusted messengers. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo said he recognizes that federal government agencies can face a trust deficit, which is why Treasury has worked hard to engage other institutions like places of worship or faith-based organizations to reach people through their communities. Faith leaders on the call shared best practices and the efforts their organizations are making to raise awareness of available federal relief programs and Mr. Sperling and the Deputy Secretary offered their continued support.

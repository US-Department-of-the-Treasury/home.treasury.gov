WASHINGTON – Earlier today, the Roosevelt Institute hosted Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo in New York for a meeting with economists and advocacy leaders to discuss what Treasury is doing to advance racial equity through the Biden-Harris economic agenda. The Deputy Secretary emphasized that the passage of the American Rescue Plan has given Treasury an opportunity to apply the principles of equity to the distribution of the nearly $1 trillion that the Department is providing to the American people, small businesses, and state and local governments. The Deputy Secretary also highlighted Treasury’s diversity recruitment efforts, increased funding to community financial depository institutions (CDFI) in order to expand access to capital to traditionally underserved groups, affordable housing issues, and the expanded advanced child tax credit.

WASHINGTON - Yesterday, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen spoke with French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. Secretary Yellen affirmed the United States’ support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and our commitment, together with our partners, to holding Russia accountable.  The Secretary expressed appreciation for France’s partnership and close coordination on Russia sanctions, which has helped to usher in unprecedented transatlantic sanctions on Russia in recent days, and stressed the need for cooperation on further strong measures.

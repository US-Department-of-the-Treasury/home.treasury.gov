NEW YORK – Today, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo spoke with Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo reiterated the importance of preventing terrorists and violent extremists from raising, using, and moving funds, and shared Treasury’s work to strengthen countering the financing of terrorism efforts globally with partners and allies. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo stressed that an economically stable West Bank strengthens Israel’s own security. He expressed the United States Government’s concern about threats by some within the Israeli government to sever correspondent banking relationships between Israeli and Palestinian banks and insisted that these should be extended for at least a year. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo stressed that extending these relations is critical to preventing an economic crisis in the West Bank, and to strengthening Israel’s security by countering financial flows funding terror groups.

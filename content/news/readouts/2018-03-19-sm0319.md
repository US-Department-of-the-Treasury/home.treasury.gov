Secretary Mnuchin attended a meeting this morning on the political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, hosted by Argentine Finance Minister Luis Caputo, along with leading finance ministers from the Western Hemisphere, the European Union and Japan. The focus was on coordinating economic measures to achieve democratic political objectives in Venezuela, addressing the economic and humanitarian tragedy, and constructive responses once Venezuela allows free, fair and regular elections. Secretary Mnuchin offered to host a follow-up meeting of the finance ministers on the margins of the World Bank/IMF Spring meeting in Washington, DC, next month.

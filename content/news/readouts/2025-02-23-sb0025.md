Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met today with Argentine Finance Minister Luis Caputo. They discussed the Milei Administration’s very impressive reform efforts to reduce inflation, rekindle private sector-led growth, reduce poverty, and increase real wages. The Secretary commended Finance Minister Caputo for macroeconomic and structural reform measures that reduce the burden of regulation on the private sector, and that reduce the size and influence of government.

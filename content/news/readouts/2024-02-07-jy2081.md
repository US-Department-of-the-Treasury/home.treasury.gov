WASHINGTON – Yesterday, U.S. Treasurer Chief Lynn Malerba delivered keynote remarks at the National American Indian Housing Council’s 2024 Legislative Conference. During her remarks, Chief Malerba discussed the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic support for Tribal communities, including efforts to strengthen housing security in Indian Country that prevented a wave of evictions and foreclosures.

In December at the White House Tribal Nation’s Summit, the Treasury Department released the[Tribal Housing Stability Report](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1959)which found that President Biden’s economic agenda stabilized housing markets in Indian Country and kept Native families in their homes. Specifically, the report details how three programs implemented under the Biden-Harris Administration – the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program, the Homeowners Assistance Fund (HAF), and the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA1) program – helped homeowners and renters in Tribal communities avoid foreclosure and eviction, stabilized housing markets in Indian Country and surrounding regions, and strengthened local and national economies. The new evidence and data presented in this report demonstrates the measurable benefits of federal programs in increasing housing supply and security in Indian Country.

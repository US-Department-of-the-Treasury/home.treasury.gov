MARRAKECH – Yesterday, Secretary Yellen participated in the Fourth Ukraine Ministerial Roundtable. The Roundtable was chaired by Finance Minister of Ukraine Sergii Marchenko, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, and World Bank President Ajay Banga.  The Roundtable has been a valuable forum for Ministers from key donors and leaders of international financial institutions to gather during the semiannual IMF and World Bank meetings to demonstrate international support for Ukraine’s economy as it responds to Russia’s brutal aggression.  Secretary Yellen commended the Government of Ukraine for its prudent economic management and stressed the need to continue fighting corruption and strengthen accountability and good governance. She welcomed the strong support for Ukraine from international partners, including the international financial institutions, and reiterated the commitment of the United States to] support Ukraine alongside our allies for as long as it takes. Secretary Yellen also called out the ways Russia’s war against Ukraine has led to devastating effects on food security around the world and urged increased support for countries dealing with these impacts.

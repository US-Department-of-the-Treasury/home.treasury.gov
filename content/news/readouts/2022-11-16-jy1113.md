WASHINGTON — Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo met today with Kemi Badenoch, the United Kingdom’s Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade, to discuss global economic conditions, opportunities to create shared economic prosperity through trade and investment, and investment security. With respect to investment security, they discussed ways to safeguard national security and opportunities to ensure US and UK intellectual and financial capital are not used to support the development of critical technologies used by foreign adversaries. In addition, following up on his trip to the United Kingdom last week, the Deputy Secretary discussed the Inflation Reduction Act’s historic climate change investment that will help the United States hit its climate goals by 2030 and create economic opportunity and growth in the U.S. and abroad, as well as the importance of building resilient clean energy supply chains.

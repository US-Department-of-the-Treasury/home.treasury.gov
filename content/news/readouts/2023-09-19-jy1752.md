WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury convened a meeting of the Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity (TACRE). The Committee is comprised of 24 experts drawn from academia, business, nonprofits, philanthropy, and other fields who help advise Department leadership on economic and fairness issues that impact historically marginalized and underserved communities.

During today’s meeting, the Committee advanced new recommendations to the Department and received an update from Lily Batchelder, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, on previous recommendations. In addition, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel provided an update on efforts to increase fairness in tax administration, including by rebalancing enforcement priorities toward high-income, high-wealth individuals, large corporations, and complex partnerships. Commissioner Werfel also discussed new efforts to pursue unscrupulous paid preparers who have targeted taxpayers across the tax system, including those who claim refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit.

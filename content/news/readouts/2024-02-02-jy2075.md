DUBAI — Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson traveled to the United Arab Emirates from January 30 - February 2, to continue coordination on regional security, terrorist financing, and other illicit finance issues.

While in the UAE, Under Secretary Nelson met with senior government officials from multiple ministries and agencies. He thanked the UAE for its continued provision of humanitarian aid to support civilians in Gaza, and noted the long partnership between the U.S. and UAE in countering terrorist financing networks. Under Secretary Nelson also conveyed Treasury’s focus on rooting out evasion of U.S. sanctions —  particularly on Russia and Iran and their proxies — and highlighted President Biden’s recent Executive Order which authorizes the targeting of foreign financial institutions facilitating transactions that benefit Russia’s military. Under Secretary Nelson emphasized the importance of maintaining coordination to jointly combat ongoing threats to regional peace and security, including from the proliferation of UAVs.

RIO DE JANEIRO – Today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with Minister of Finance Shun’ichi Suzuki of Japan on the margins of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Secretary Yellen underscored her appreciation for the steps Japan has taken to combat Russia’s brutal, illegal, and unjust war in Ukraine, including Japan’s partnership in the G7’s efforts to launch “Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration” loans that unlock the value of immobilized Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s resistance and aid its long-term reconstruction. Secretary Yellen also raised important international tax priorities.

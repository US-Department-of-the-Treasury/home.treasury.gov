WASHINGTON - Earlier today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen held a call with United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak.  The Secretary thanked Chancellor Sunak for the actions the United Kingdom took on Tuesday in response to Russian aggression and noted that our joint actions will impose severe costs on Russia for its blatant disregard of international law and the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Secretary Yellen expressed that continued close coordination between the United States, the United Kingdom, and within the G7  reflects our unity and resolve to respond to further Russian aggression.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo spoke with Ukrainian Minister of Finance Sergii Marchenko ahead of his travel to Europe, where he will continue working with partners and Allies to impose costs on Russia for its brutal and illegal war of choice. The Deputy Secretary voiced fervent support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s unprovoked and premeditated invasion of Ukraine and renewed the U.S. commitment to support Ukraine’s economy.

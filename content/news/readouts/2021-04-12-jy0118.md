WASHINGTON - Earlier today, Andy Baukol, Performing the Duties of Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, and Ambassador Donald Booth, U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan, co-hosted a virtual roundtable event to advance Sudan’s efforts to secure debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.  Treasury welcomed the participation of His Excellency Dr. Gebril Ibrahim, Sudan’s Minister of Finance and Economic Planning, along with representatives from over 20 countries and from the IMF, World Bank, African Development Bank, and Paris Club.  Mr. Baukol highlighted the progress Sudan’s civilian-led transitional government has made in implementing macroeconomic reforms.  He also outlined the remaining steps in the path to debt relief, called on participants to fully support Sudan in its efforts to reach the first phase of the HIPC process by mid-2021, and urged all IMF members to support expeditious clearance of Sudan’s IMF arrears.

MEXICO CITY — On August 2-3, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg and Acting Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Himamauli Das met with counterparts from the Government of Mexico at the Strategic Dialogue on Illicit Finance (SDIF) in Mexico City, co-hosted by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and Mexico’s Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera. These meetings focused on the illicit finance threats facing both countries, such as the trafficking of narcotics, including deadly synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, and their precursors. Participants discussed how both governments can continue to work together to combat these threats. The SDIF is a key bilateral forum advancing the U.S. - Mexico Bicentennial Framework anti-money laundering and countering terrorism finance goals. The Treasury officials also met with financial institutions from Mexico and the United States to discuss shared priorities, including combatting corruption, advancing public-private partnerships to counter illicit finance, and fighting drug, arms, and human trafficking.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo met with members of the Affordable Housing Developers Council (AHDC) to discuss the need for more affordable housing options and efforts to keep people safely housed during the pandemic. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo highlighted the work Treasury is doing through the Emergency Rental Assistance program, which served an additional 510,000 households through September 30th with payments totaling nearly $2.8 billion. The Deputy Secretary also emphasized the Biden Administration’s commitment to making more affordable housing options available to families across the country – including by boosting the supply of quality, affordable rental and single-family units. Members of the AHDC, a coalition of the nation’s top affordable housing development companies, shared trends they are seeing in the communities they serve and how policies could better help achieve shared affordable housing goals.

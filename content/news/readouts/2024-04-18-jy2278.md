WASHINGTON – Yesterday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo joined a roundtable hosted by the Corporate Council on Africa (CCA) on U.S.-Africa Trade and Investment on the margins of the IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings. Participants included finance ministers from Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Nigeria, and Zambia, as well as deputy finance minister from South Africa.

Discussion revolved around the role of finance ministries in strengthening the investment climate, maximizing the potential of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), and building well-maintained and climate-resilient infrastructure, and supporting clean energy supply chains. Participants raised the importance of reinforcing strong macroeconomic management, tackling corruption, and improving the regulatory environment to help unlock investment. The roundtable also highlighted the need for international collaboration and private sector engagement to identify evolving challenges and find solutions.

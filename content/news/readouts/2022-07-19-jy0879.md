SEOUL — Today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen hosted a roundtable discussion in Seoul, Republic of Korea, with women entrepreneurs and business leaders.  The participants discussed the Korean economy and opportunities to increase the representation of women in leadership positions.  The Secretary underscored that economies are stronger when they are built on dynamic and inclusive labor markets that provide opportunities for women to join, stay and thrive in the workforce.  Secretary Yellen noted that these modern supply-side economic policies can also help address labor shortages and lower inflation.

Participants included Hyojin Lee, founder and CEO of 8percent; Jenna Lee, founder and CEO of AIM; Hyemin Lee, co-founder and CEO of Finda; JiHye Park, marketing manager at Google for Startups; and Cindy Jin, partner at SoftBank Ventures Asia.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury yesterday hosted a Transition Finance Dialogue with representatives from a range of financial institutions, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders about how financial institutions can support or enable the net-zero transition. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen and Ethan Zindler, Climate Counselor to the Secretary, highlighted Treasury’s recent work to encourage financial institutions and other market participants to realize the opportunities created by the transition to clean energy. Treasury officials then engaged participants about overcoming challenges in defining, measuring, and scaling transition finance, as well as the opportunities for mobilizing private finance for the clean energy transition through the Inflation Reduction Act. The discussion was part of Treasury’s ongoing engagement with financial sector stakeholders committed to supporting and expediting the transition to a low-carbon economy.

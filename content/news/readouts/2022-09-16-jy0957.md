WASHINGTON – Today, Secretary Yellen spoke with Chancellor of the Exchequer Kwasi Kwarteng of the United Kingdom.  The Secretary offered her deepest condolences on the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.  Secretary Yellen highlighted the importance of the longstanding U.S.-UK bilateral relationship and congratulated Chancellor Kwarteng on his appointment.  She discussed shared efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustifiable war against Ukraine, including finalizing and implementing a price cap on Russian oil to stabilize global energy prices while denying Russia revenue to fund its brutal war.  The Secretary also raised the importance of addressing Ukraine’s near-term economic assistance needs and working together to support an inclusive international effort to address Ukraine’s future recovery and reconstruction.

WASHINGTON -- Earlier today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen spoke with European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni.

In advance of the OECD Inclusive Framework meeting later this week, and G7 and G20 Finance Minister meetings later this month, Secretary Yellen and Commissioner Gentiloni discussed the importance of OECD Inclusive Framework reaching consensus on Pillars 1 and 2.

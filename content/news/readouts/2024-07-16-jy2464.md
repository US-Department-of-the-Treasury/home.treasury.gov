WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen and Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm hosted a working dinner with CEOs of leading companies in the clean energy economy. During the meeting, Secretary Yellen, Secretary Granholm, and CEOs discussed the impact of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, the most significant climate law in history, which is fueling private sector investments in American clean energy and creating new, good-paying jobs in communities across the nation. CEOs shared ideas on ways the private and public sectors can work together to accelerate investments in America’s clean energy economy, and Secretaries Yellen and Granholm both underscored the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to continue collaborating with the private sector to implement the Inflation Reduction Act. Secretaries Yellen and Granholm also highlighted the Administration’s recent work to support the private sector in the clean energy transition, including Treasury’s Principles for Net-Zero Financing and Investment, which was released last year to provide guidance to financial institutions pursuing net-zero commitments, as well as the Administration’s Principles for Responsible Participation in Voluntary Carbon Markets.

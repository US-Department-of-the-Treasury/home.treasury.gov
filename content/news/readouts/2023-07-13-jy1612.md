WASHINGTON – This week the Department of the Treasury’s Office of State and Local Finance held the second convening of its Summer Series on Resources for the State, Local, and Tribal Government Climate Transition. These monthly virtual convenings focus on climate-oriented tools and resources for the municipal sector and will include presentations from federal agencies, industry organizations, and academic institutions.

 

The third convening included Treasury and federal agency staff and participants from trade associations, coalitions, think tanks, networks, and other organizations that support state, local, territorial, and tribal governments. They discussed how state and local governments can build disaster resilience through opportunities provided in the Community Disaster Resilience Zones Act of 2022 (CDRZ) and accelerate community-led infrastructure projects through the Milken Institute’s Community Infrastructure Center and the 10,000 Communities Initiative. Speakers and presenters included:

 

* Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)

 

* Milken Institute

 

Treasury looks forward to additional convenings and supporting efforts by state, local, territorial and tribal governments to adapt to the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change and the climate transition.

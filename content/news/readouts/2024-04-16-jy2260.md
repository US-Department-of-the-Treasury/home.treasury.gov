Under Secretary Nelson noted that Treasury encourages U.S. financial institutions to continue to use, and potentially expand, their existing processes to gather and share information with foreign financial institutions in furtherance of investigations that involve illicit cross-border activity. Deputy Secretary Yorio highlighted the commitment to foster information sharing between private sector entities and emphasized the support that Mexico has given to information-sharing mechanisms between Mexican and foreign banks and among Mexican banks. The legal framework for such mechanisms has been developed through regulatory updates and regular communication with the banks, which are key allies in combating illicit finance flows.

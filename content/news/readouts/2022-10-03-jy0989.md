WASHINGTON—Last Friday, the U.S. Department of the Treasury hosted a discussion with banks engaged in work on net-zero commitments.  Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang, Climate Counselor to the Secretary John Morton, and officials from across the Treasury Department engaged banks to better understand how they are setting, implementing, and accounting for net-zero targets.  The discussion focused on best practices, transparency, opportunities, and challenges for banks in their efforts to finance net zero-aligned activities. The discussion was part of an ongoing effort by Treasury to engage external stakeholders who play an essential role in the net zero transition. Treasury is interested in finding ways to encourage transparent and accountable progress toward meeting our climate goals. Attendees present included representatives from Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

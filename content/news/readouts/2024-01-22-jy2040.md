WASHINGTON – Today, Under Secretary for International Affairs Jay Shambaugh spoke with Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko to discuss critical economic assistance and international efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unjustified and unprovoked war on Ukraine. Under Secretary Shambaugh highlighted the Administration's ongoing efforts to secure the full $11.8 billion in direct budget support as part of the national security supplemental request before Congress, which combined with other international support will enable Ukraine to continue defending itself and help maintain access to Ukraine’s $15.6 billion IMF program. Under Secretary Shambaugh and Minister Marchenko also discussed continued cooperation through the G7 as well as the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform.

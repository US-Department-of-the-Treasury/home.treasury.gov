WASHINGTON—Yesterday, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Office of the U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate (SPEC) hosted a discussion with asset managers and insurers that are working to incorporate climate considerations into investment decisions and greenhouse gas reduction commitments, including net-zero commitments. Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang and officials from across the Treasury Department and SPEC engaged asset managers and insurers to better understand how climate risks impact their investments, opportunities for engagement activities, enhanced climate disclosures, and key considerations associated with greenhouse gas reduction and climate adaptation efforts, both organizationally and with respect to their clients. The discussion focused on climate-related best practices, opportunities, and ongoing challenges associated with asset management and insurance investment activities. The discussion was part of an ongoing effort by Treasury and SPEC to engage external stakeholders that are committed to supporting and expediting the transition to a low-carbon economy. Treasury and SPEC are interested in finding ways to encourage transparent and accountable progress toward meeting climate challenges and goals.

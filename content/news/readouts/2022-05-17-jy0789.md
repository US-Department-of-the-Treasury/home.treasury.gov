BRUSSELS—Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, as well as European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis and European Commissioner for the Economy Paolo Gentiloni.  Secretary Yellen emphasized that the United States stands with Ukraine and welcomed Europe’s close cooperation in holding Russia accountable for its illegal and unprovoked war.  The Secretary discussed the need for the international community to provide economic assistance to Ukraine.  The Secretary also discussed Europe’s efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.

Further, Secretary Yellen identified ways to move forward on the international tax reform agreement. Secretary Yellen also reaffirmed the U.S.’s commitment to both Pillars 1 and 2. One hundred and thirty seven countries representing nearly 95% of the world’s GDP agreed last fall on a deal that will stabilize our tax systems, provide resources to invest in security and respond to crises like Covid-19, and ensure corporations fairly share the burden of financing government.

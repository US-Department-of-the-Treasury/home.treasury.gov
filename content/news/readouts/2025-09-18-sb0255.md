On September 18, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley met with the Mexican Banking Association in Mexico City. He discussed strengthening joint efforts to combat drug cartels and disrupt the flow of deadly fentanyl into the United States in line with President Trump’s mandate by enhancing compliance.

During the meeting, Under Secretary Hurley emphasized that Mexico’s financial sector plays a critical role in defending against illicit finance and pointed to our public advisories and alerts as key tools to help the banks improve their compliance. He underscored Treasury’s commitment to cutting off cartel funding and highlighted recent enforcement actions (2313a) as evidence of the United States’ determination to ensure the private sector does its part to dismantle cartel networks.

The Under Secretary also expressed deep appreciation for the strong partnership between the United States and Mexico, noting the vital role of both government and industry in advancing shared security goals. The discussion focused on enhancing cooperation to ensure stronger compliance and more effective outcomes in the fight against cartel financing.

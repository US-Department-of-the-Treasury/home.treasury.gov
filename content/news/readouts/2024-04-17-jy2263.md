WASHINGTON – On April 17, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo met jointly with Estonian Minister of Finance Mart Võrklaev, Latvian Minister of Finance Arvils Ašeradens, Lithuanian Minister of Finance Gintarė Skaistė, and Polish Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance Paweł Karbownik. They discussed their commitment to Ukraine and building on the unprecedented sanctions taken against Russia to stop its unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine. In particular, they discussed ways to continue providing near-term financial assistance to Ukraine, as well as ways to unlock the value of immobilized Russian sovereign assets to support Ukraine’s continued resistance and long-term reconstruction. They also discussed the ways to constrain Russia’s access to the goods it needs to build weapons, including the role China plays in supplying Russia’s military industrial complex. The Deputy Secretary noted the leadership of these countries on implementing multilateral sanctions, especially the price cap on Russia’s oil.

WASHINGTON – Yesterday,  Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo and Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco convened the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force Deputies to coordinate lines of effort to ensure that Russia bears the legal consequences of its internationally wrongful acts.

Today’s task force meeting convened experts across the U.S. government and international community to explore all possible avenues to aid Ukraine – consistent with respective legal systems and international law – and to ensure Ukraine is compensated for the loss, injury and damage resulting from Russia’s full-scale aggression.

As Russia continues to commit flagrant violations of international law, REPO members remain united that, consistent with their respective legal systems, Russia’s sovereign assets in REPO jurisdictions will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine. Given the urgent needs of Ukraine and the paramount importance of holding Russia accountable for its illegal invasion of Ukraine, principals of the REPO Task Force plan to convene again later this year.

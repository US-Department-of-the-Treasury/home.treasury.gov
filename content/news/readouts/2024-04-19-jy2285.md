WASHINGTON – Today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen hosted finance ministers of member countries of the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity (APEP). Together with Inter-American Development Bank President (IDB) Ilan Goldfajn, they discussed the work of the IDB to support APEP members in enhancing competitiveness in the sectors identified at the APEP Leaders’ Summit that was hosted by President Biden in November 2023: critical minerals, the medical sector, and semiconductors. Secretary Yellen commended the work of APEP finance ministers on the recent decisions to provide $3.5 billion in new capital for the IDB Group’s private sector window, IDB Invest, and on reforms to strengthen the effectiveness of the IDB Group in supporting private sector-led, sustainable, and inclusive growth in Latin America and the Caribbean.

WASHINGTON — Today, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo spoke with Ukraine Minister of Finance Sergii Marchenko to discuss U.S. economic assistance for Ukraine and international efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unjustified and unprovoked war on Ukraine.  Deputy Secretary Adeyemo reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to Ukraine and discussed international economic assistance provided by donor countries, including the recent additional contribution from the United States to Ukraine of $1.7 billion in direct budgetary support.  Deputy Secretary Adeyemo reiterated that the U.S. Treasury continues to use its sanctions authorities to degrade Russia’s ability to wage its war in Ukraine and threaten its neighbors.  Deputy Secretary Adeyemo and Minister Marchenko also discussed progress made toward implementing a price cap on Russian oil to restrict revenue for Russia’s military while dampening the impact of Putin’s war on global oil and energy prices.

WASHINGTON – This week the Department of the Treasury’s Office of State and Local Finance held the second convening of its Summer Series on Resources for the State and Local Government Climate*Transition*. These monthly virtual convenings focus on climate-oriented tools and resources for the municipal sector and will include presentations from federal agencies, industry organizations, and academic institutions.

The second convening included Treasury staff and more than 50 participants from trade associations, coalitions, think tanks, networks, and other organizations that support state, local, territorial, and tribal governments. They discussed how state and local governments can take advantage of opportunities in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and shared updates on climate programs at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) including its Climate Pollution Reduction Grants and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Speakers and presenters included:

* Treasury Department Office of Tax Policy

* Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

* Climate Mayors, C40, and the Urban Sustainability Directors Network

Treasury looks forward to additional convenings and supporting efforts by state, local, territorial and tribal government to adapt to the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change and the climate transition.

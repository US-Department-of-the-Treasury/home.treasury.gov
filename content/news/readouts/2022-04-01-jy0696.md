U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met yesterday with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness, Finance Minister Nigel Clarke, and Foreign Affairs Minister Kamina Johnson Smith to underscore our countries’ close partnership and shared priorities for building climate resilience, strengthening sustainable infrastructure development, and promoting digitalization, all of which the Build Back Better World initiative advances.  The Secretary welcomed Jamaica’s commitment to sustainable public finances, investment climate strengthening, and targeted social investments.  The Secretary discussed the impact on Jamaica of the commodity shock triggered by Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, including the President’s decision to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Secretary Yellen also congratulated Finance Minister Clarke on his election as the Chair of the Inter-American Development Bank Group’s Board of Governors, which will engage this year on strengthening the responsiveness of the IDB Group, including considering the case for new capital for its private sector window.

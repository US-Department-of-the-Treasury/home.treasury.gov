WASHINGTON — Today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi.  Secretary Yellen discussed efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustifiable war against Ukraine, including progress toward a price cap on Russian oil to lower global energy prices and restrict Russia’s revenue.  Secretary Yellen highlighted the importance of collectively supporting Ukraine’s economic assistance needs.  She also noted recent passage of the historic Inflation Reduction Act, which represents the most aggressive action in fighting climate change in U.S. history, and discussed U.S.-UK climate cooperation in the lead up to COP27 in November.

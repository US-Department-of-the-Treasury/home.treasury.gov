WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Secretary of the Treasury Scott K.H. Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Sang-mok Choi and Minister of Trade, Industry, and Energy Duk-geun Ahn of South Korea.

Secretary Bessent welcomed South Korea’s fast and positive engagement with the United States following President Trump’s call with Acting President Han on April 8. Secretary Bessent was encouraged by their discussions’ focus on an expanded equilibrium which encourages rather than restricts trade. The Secretary thanked the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for their efforts to balance the U.S.-Korea bilateral relationship by reducing trade barriers and increasing South Korean investment into the United States.

Both the Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister reaffirmed the strong bilateral relationship between the United States and South Korea and agreed to further productive discussions, including on currency policy.

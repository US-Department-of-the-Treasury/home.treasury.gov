WASHINGTON – Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo attended a series of engagements in Houston, Texas to discuss the American Rescue Plan – including the expanded, monthly Child Tax Credit (CTC) and the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program – which have enabled communities to recover from the pandemic. The Deputy Secretary joined Congressman Al Green and Congresswoman Sylvia Garcia to visit VN Teamwork, Inc.‘s Golden Bamboo Village to meet with community partners and advocates who are signing up families for the CTC, and parents who have already seen the benefits. This event follows Treasury and IRS’s announcement this week that roughly $15 billion were paid to families that include nearly 60 million children, in the first monthly payment. The group discussed plans to continue to reach out to eligible families who are eligible for this historic tax relief.Deputy Secretary Adeyemo also attended a roundtable discussion hosted by the Greater Houston Partnership to discuss the city’s economic recovery and how the Administration’s American Families Plan and American Jobs Plan will help build a strong economic future. The Deputy Secretary underscored the Administration’s commitment to supporting American businesses, including with investments in infrastructure like roads, bridges, and broadband that boost the nation’s competitiveness.In addition, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo joined Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo and Mayor Pro Tem Dave Martin at the BakerRipley Gulfton Sharpstown Campus to discuss the Houston-Harris County successes with the ERA program. On campus, Deputy Secretary attended an ERA program navigator enrollment event to meet with grantees and discuss how they have successfully deployed resources to ensure families can stay in their homes. Grantees shared best practices resulting from the city-county partnership, strong community based organization support, and robust outreach efforts, particularly in the most vulnerable communities.

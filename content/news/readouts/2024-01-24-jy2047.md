While in Tokyo, the Deputy Secretary thanked his government counterparts for Japan’s leadership and strong support of Ukraine throughout their recent G7 presidency.In addition to meetings with government officials, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo also met with major financial institutions to discuss continued work by the G7 and other partners and allies to degrade Russia’s ability to financially sustain its illegal war, including through the price cap on Russian oil and President Biden’s amended Executive Order (E.O.) targeting sanctions evasion through third countries. He noted that the E.O. specifically targets foreign financial institutions facilitating transactions that benefit Russia’s military, including their attempts to purchase critical inputs produced in countries like the United States and Japan.Deputy Secretary Adeyemo also discussed the critical minerals agreement signed between the United States and Japan last year to diversify key supply chains and strengthen the U.S.-Japan bilateral economic and trade relationship

Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager.  They discussed the United States’ implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act and the European Union’s Green Deal Industrial Plan, developments in the international financial system, and the Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue.  The Dialogue was announced by President Biden and President von der Leyen on March 10, when they stressed the importance of implementing U.S. and EU incentive programs so that they are mutually reinforcing.  Secretary Yellen and EVP Vestager co-chaired the first meeting of the Dialogue today, during which they discussed the future work plan.  The Dialogue aims to facilitate (i)  the sharing of information on the respective incentive programs of the United States and the EU and (ii) the joint analysis of non-market policies and practices of third parties that create dependencies on non-market economies for clean energy goods and technologies.

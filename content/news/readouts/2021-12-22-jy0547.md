WASHINGTON -- Ahead of the release of Treasury’s[General Licenses and guidance in support of humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0545), Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo hosted a roundtable with over 100 representatives from more than 50 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to reinforce the U.S. government’s commitment to supporting humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan.

He heard directly from the NGOs operating on the ground in Afghanistan about their experiences delivering aid and the challenges they face. The Deputy Secretary explained Treasury’s commitment to supporting the Afghan people, its close partnership with NGOs, and answered questions about steps Treasury is taking to facilitate access to humanitarian assistance and aid and Treasury’s authorizations on topics such as education, donations of medical supplies, and the role of private sector financial institutions.

As the largest single provider of humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan, the U.S. is committed to ensuring that aid continues to flow to the Afghan people.  While Treasury continues to uphold and enforce its economic sanctions on the Taliban, the department regularly engages with the NGO sector on its existing humanitarian authorizations and public guidance, as part of Treasury’s commitment to facilitating the flow of humanitarian assistance to areas affected by U.S. sanctions.

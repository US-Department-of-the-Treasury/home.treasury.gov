WASHINGTON -- Today, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo hosted an anti-corruption roundtable with leaders of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to discuss Treasury’s anti-corruption strategy and priorities. Treasury has a longstanding commitment to identifying and countering corruption, particularly the way it intersects with the U.S. and global financial systems. This year, Treasury has redoubled efforts, in line with the Biden-Harris Administration’s whole-of-government strategy to combat corruption and is taking numerous actions to advance anti-corruption strategies and achieve our goals. Treasury has taken several recent actions to combat corruption, including issuing a[FinCEN Advisory on Kleptocracy and Foreign Public Corruption](https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/advisory/2022-04-14/FinCEN%20Advisory%20Corruption%20FINAL%20508.pdf),[designating corrupt actors in the Western Balkans](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0712), and[traveling to work with international partners tackling this issue](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0669).

Participants discussed actions to enhance transparency and close loopholes in U.S. legal and regulatory frameworks to further the fight against corruption. They also shared ideas on how to leverage multilateral bodies, public-private partnerships, and other multi-stakeholder processes. In particular, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo discussed the need to effectively communicate on core issues related to corruption and shared views on leveraging the Financial Action Task Force to combat corruption.

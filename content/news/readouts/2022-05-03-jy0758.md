LOS ANGELES - Today, the National Asian Pacific Islander American Chamber of Commerce and Entrepreneurship (National ACE) and Asian Business Association (ABA) hosted Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo for a roundtable with AAPI business owners from the greater Los Angeles Area in recognition of the start of AAPI Heritage Month. Taking place at Taste of MP, an AAPI-owned restaurant in Monterey Park, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo discussed the important role AAPI-owned businesses play in growing the national economy. He also highlighted efforts the Treasury is undertaking to advance equity and opportunity for minority-owned businesses and entrepreneurs through recovery programs such as the Emergency Capital Investment Program (ECIP) and the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI). Deputy Secretary Adeyemo also acknowledged the dual challenge AAPI businesses face with both the pandemic recovery and rise in unprovoked attacks on AAPI individuals, and he invited attendees to share their insights on Treasury’s programs as well as the opportunities and challenges ahead for AAPI entrepreneurs.

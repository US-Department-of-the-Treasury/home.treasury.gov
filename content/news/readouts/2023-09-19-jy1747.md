NEW YORK – Today, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang, and Climate Counselor Ethan Zindler, met with leaders of some of the largest technical non-governmental organizations (NGOs) focused on supporting the implementation of net-zero commitments by financial institutions and facilitating the transition to a clean energy economy. Participants discussed the importance of promoting consistency among voluntary standards and best practices for net-zero transition plans, and identified gaps in available data and technical resources and priorities for future work.  In addition, some of these technical NGO leaders announced new commitments to develop further technical work to support financial institutions in developing and implementing net-zero transition plans and related efforts. Earlier in the day Treasury released its Net-Zero Principles for Financing & Investment.

Attendees present included representatives from Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), Ceres, Climate Policy Institute (CPI), E3G, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI), UN Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI), and World Wildlife Foundation (WWF).

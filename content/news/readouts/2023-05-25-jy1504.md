WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Department of the Treasury Chief Implementation Officer Laurel Blatchford and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Acting Chief Transformation Officer Bridget Roberts convened a roundtable discussion with civil rights and advocacy organizations to discuss the need to make tax filing easier and less expensive for taxpayers, particularly in underserved communities.

During the conversation, Treasury and IRS officials discussed taxpayer support for a free online filing option provided by the IRS and the development of a pilot program for a Direct File option during the 2024 filing season.

Under the vision detailed in the IRS Strategic Operating Plan, taxpayers will be able to seamlessly interact with the IRS in the ways that work best for them on the phone, in-person, and online. By piloting a free option to file taxes online directly with the IRS, Treasury and IRS will be able to glean new information to improve and develop customer service tools.

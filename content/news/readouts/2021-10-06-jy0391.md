WASHINGTON – Earlier today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen spoke with Estonia Finance Minister Keit Pentus-Rosimannus to discuss the importance of reaching a deal to reshape the global tax system. Secretary Yellen conveyed how achieving consensus on a global minimum tax is a top priority, and that it would stop the race to the bottom on corporate taxes and restore equity for the middle class and working-class people both in the U.S. and around the world. In advance of the OECD Inclusive Framework meeting later this week and leading up to the G20 Leader’s Meeting at the end of October, Secretary Yellen also conveyed that efforts to improve the global tax regime would also ensure that profitable corporations pay their fair share and provide governments with the resources to invest in their people and economies.

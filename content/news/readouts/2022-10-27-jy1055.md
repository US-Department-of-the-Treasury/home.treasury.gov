WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo participated in a virtual roundtable with key stakeholders on climate impact, equity, and the Inflation Reduction Act. The roundtable is part of a series of discussions the Treasury Department is hosting as it solicits input from the public to inform its work implementing the Inflation Reduction Act. Nearly three quarters of the Inflation Reduction Act’s $369 billion climate change investment – $270 billion – is delivered via tax incentives, putting Treasury at the forefront of this landmark law.

Deputy Secretary Adeyemo was joined by White House Senior Advisor for Clean Energy Implementation and Innovation John Podesta, U.S. Treasurer Chief Lynn Malerba, Treasury Climate Counselor John Morton, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Lily Batchelder, and Treasury Counselor for Racial Equity Janis Bowdler.

The roundtable featured 18 leaders from major climate advocacy organizations, environmental justice groups, and labor unions.

Deputy Secretary Adeyemo emphasized that the Inflation Reduction Act tackles the climate crisis head on, putting President Biden’s 2030 climate goals within reach and providing support to communities on the front lines. He outlined key provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act that will help build an equitable clean energy economy, including targeted place-based incentives to spur clean energy-related economic development in low-income communities and energy communities; strong labor protections through prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards; and direct payment of tax incentives for state, local, and Tribal governments, as well as tax-exempt entities, to expand the range of actors with a direct incentive to invest in their communities.

Today’s discussion built on an earlier dialogue with community-based organizations and financial institutions held as part of the Freedman’s Bank Forum on October 4. In conjunction with that dialogue, Treasury released a[fact sheet](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjEwMjYuNjU3MTE5NjEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2hvbWUudHJlYXN1cnkuZ292L3N5c3RlbS9maWxlcy8xMzYvRmFjdC1TaGVldC1JUkEtRXF1aXRhYmxlLUNsZWFuLUVuZXJneS1FY29ub215LnBkZiJ9.2oyXkZPelu1ofWWM8JkqNrvc7puZsh97AXU_-Mvnepg/s/1173460507/br/146779830088-l)outlining how the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy tax incentives will support building an equitable clean energy economy.

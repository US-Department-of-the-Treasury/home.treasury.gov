WASHINGTON—Yesterday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo led a roundtable discussion with more than 20 key stakeholders on IRS efforts to use resources provided by the Inflation Reduction Act to upgrade service for all taxpayers, including underserved communities, this tax filing season and improve accessibility and tax fairness over the coming decade.

During the conversation, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo highlighted how improvements to customer service on the phone, online, and in-person will benefit taxpayers from underserved communities, ensuring returns are processed more quickly and that taxpayers are able to access credits and benefits for which they are eligible in a timely manner. He also discussed ways in which a better-resourced IRS can make the tax code fairer by ensuring wealthy Americans and corporations can’t evade taxes they owe.

The Deputy Secretary and national advocates were joined by U.S. Treasury and IRS officials, including Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Lily Batchelder and Counselor for Racial Equity Janis Bowdler.

Yesterday’s roundtable was part of an ongoing series of convenings the Deputy Secretary has held since the IRA was passed in August. In addition to hearing from civil rights leaders and national advocates, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo has also convened roundtables with labor leaders, climate change organizations, renewable energy investors, and small businesses.

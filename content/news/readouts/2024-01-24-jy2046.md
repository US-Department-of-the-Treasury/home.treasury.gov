WASHINGTON – Today, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo participated in a fireside conversation at the Roosevelt Institute’s Roosevelt Society inaugural event. During the conversation, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo highlighted how the Treasury Department has prioritized equity at a policy and institutional level.

Under the leadership of Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen, the Treasury Department has prioritized what Secretary Yellen has coined as “modern supply-side economics” — an economic strategy to expand the economy’s long-term productive capacity while reducing inequalities.

Deputy Secretary Adeyemo highlighted Treasury’s work at an institutional level, including Secretary Yellen appointing the Department’s first ever Counselor for Racial Equity, establishing the first of its kind Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity, launching a career level policy team known as the Equity Hub to support research, analysis, and policy design, and hiring the most diverse leadership in the Department’s history.

Deputy Secretary Adeyemo also discussed the Treasury Department’s efforts to build an economy where all Americans can achieve financial security and reach their full economic potential. To advance this goal, the Treasury Department has also put equity and ensuring broad-based economic growth at the center of policy implementation across the American Rescue Plan and Inflation Reduction Act. This prioritization has helped lead to the most equitable economic recovery from a recession on record.

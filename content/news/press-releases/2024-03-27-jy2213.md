*The United States and United Kingdom take coordinated actions against a Hamas-linked fundraiser and its partners.*

WASHINGTON — Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated two individuals and three entities as key financial facilitators involved in fundraising for Hamas. In the wake of the October 7, 2023 terrorist attack perpetrated by Hamas against Israel, **Gaza Now**engaged in fundraising efforts to support Hamas.**Gaza Now**and its founder**Mustafa Ayash**, as well**Al-Qureshi Executives**and**Aakhirah Limited**, and their director**Aozma Sultana**, partnered on multiple fundraising efforts. This action is being taken as part of a collaborative effort with the United Kingdom’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, which is implementing sanctions on these same targets.

“Treasury remains committed to degrading Hamas’ ability to finance its terrorist activities, including through online fundraising campaigns that seek to funnel money directly to the group,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “The United States, in close coordination with our British partners, will continue to leverage our tools to disrupt Hamas’ ability to facilitate further attacks.”

The United States and UK have already conducted three coordinated sanctions actions related to Hamas fundraising efforts since October 7, 2023, including a [November 14, 2023](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1907) action against Hamas leaders and financiers, a [December 13, 2023](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1981) action against additional Hamas financial officials and representatives, and a [January 22, 2024](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2036) U.S., UK, and Australia action against additional Hamas financial networks and facilitators of virtual currency transfers.

## SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONs

As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC. In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked. Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.

Furthermore, engaging in certain transactions with persons designated today entails risk of secondary sanctions pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended. Pursuant to this authority, OFAC can prohibit or impose strict conditions on the opening or maintaining in the United States of a correspondent account or a payable-through account of a foreign financial institution that knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant transaction on behalf of a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.

In addition, non-U.S. financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions risk or be subject to an enforcement action. The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.

The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the SDN List, but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law. The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior. For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, please refer to [OFAC’s Frequently Asked Question 897 here](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/897).

Treasury remains committed to enabling the flow of legitimate humanitarian assistance supporting the basic human needs of vulnerable populations, while continuing to deny resources to malicious actors. Accordingly, OFAC sanctions programs contain [provisions for legitimate humanitarian support to vulnerable populations](https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/931341/download?inline), including authorizations for certain humanitarian transactions in support of nongovernmental organizations’ activities. For more information, please review [relevant authorizations and guidance on OFAC’s website](https://ofac.treasury.gov/). On November 14, 2023, OFAC issued a [Compliance Communique](https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/932311/download?inline) which provides additional guidance for the provision of humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people.

* The Biden Administration announced a series of measures to boost small and minority-owned businesses ahead of its annual Freedman’s Bank Forum, which focuses on economic opportunity for communities of color.*

* A group of large banks and foundations called the Economic Opportunity Coalition will commit to securing $3 billion in deposits for lenders that target underserved groups, including rural Americans and minorities, Adeyemo told reporters ahead of Wednesday’s event. The pledge is an increase over the $1 billion commitment the EOC made last year to community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions.*

* Search giant Google also committed to spending at least $1 billion annually with diverse-owned suppliers in the US, Adeyemo said. Micron Technology, Xcel Energy and Air Products committed to steering 15% of their contract spending on outside goods and services toward small and underserved businesses by 2025.*

### Reuters: Biden officials set $3 bln bank deposit, procurement goals to boost minority firms

* The Biden administration on Wednesday urged big companies to deposit another $2 billion into U.S. community lenders to boost loans to minority and underserved businesses, and asked them to devote 15% of their procurement budgets to such firms. *

* Chip maker Micron Technology (MU.O), industrial gases producer Air Products (APD.N) and utility Xcel Energy (XEL.O) have agreed to commit at least 15% of their contract spending to "small and underserved" firms, the Treasury Department said.*

### The Black Wall Street Times: Black Businesses: Biden-Harris announces $3B investment

* In June, the EOC announced that it had reached the goal made at last year’s Freedman’s Bank Forum and secured $1 billion in committed deposits in CDFIs and MDIs. Today’s announcement includes a 200% increase of this original goal, ensuring billions of dollars will reach low-income, rural, and other underserved communities*

* The Treasury Department has worked closely with the EOC to maximize the impact of federal investments, particularly in underserved communities that are building infrastructure for sustainable economic development. For instance, EOC investments complement the Department’s more than $8.5 billion in investments to CDFIs and MDIs through the Emergency Capital Investment Program.*

* Among other things, these funds support CDFIs and MDIs in providing loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, especially in low-income and underserved communities.*

### Reuters: Yellen says community banking investments boost lending to Black, Latino firms sharply

Harris said on Tuesday, Oct. 25 at the Department of the Treasury during the Freedman's Bank Forum 2023.*

### Yahoo! Finance: Pandemic aid created 'the most equitable' economic recovery in recent history: Treasury report

* Policy actions taken during the pandemic led to "the most equitable" recovery in recent history, a new government report found.*

* The study released first to Yahoo Finance on Monday by the Treasury Department found that the president’s American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), along with actions taken by state and local governments, prevented the worst economic outcomes for Black and Hispanic families during the COVID pandemic, groups that were the hardest hit during that time and have historically been more vulnerable to downturns.*

* The federal aid — including stimulus checks, rental assistance, and the expanded child tax credit — in combination with local support and the Federal Reserve efforts helped sustain Black and Hispanic household finances, narrow the wealth gap, and improve some economic indicators relative to the pre-pandemic period.*

### Axios: Post-COVID economic recovery among racial groups "most equitable in recent history"

* Unlike modern recessions that have seen Black and Hispanic workers bear the disproportionate brunt of the downturn, that didn't happen during the pandemic's recession and recovery.*

* The gap in economic results among racial groups has narrowed in the last three years, making this recovery "the most equitable in recent history," as a new Treasury Department report puts it.*

* The median net worth of Black and Hispanic families rose 60% and 47%, respectively, from 2019 to 2022.*

* The more equitable results reflect the power of fiscal policy to channel money to those who most need it in an economic downturn.*

In 2021, for example, nearly 25% of new entrepreneurs in the U.S. were Latino, while the Latino employer experienced a 25% increase in revenue during the pandemic and its subsequent recovery.*

* The department details how federal investments, including those from President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan, are growing and sustaining Latino-owned businesses.*

* With these data, the growth of the Latino community since Joe Biden's term in office is evident. In addition, it reaffirms the contribution that Latinos make to the U.S. economy.*

Secretary John W. Snow today addressed the first meeting of the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform. WhileAmerica remains known for its economic flexibility and dynamism, our tax code has grown larger and more burdensome with every passing year, he said. Tax reform is a key priority for the President, and for the American people. The President has asked this bipartisan panel to come up with some options, guided by the goals of increased fairness, simplicity, and economic growth and job creation. I look forward to reviewing your proposals.

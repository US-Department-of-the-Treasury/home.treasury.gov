We are very pleased with the IMF Executive Board's decision to approve the nomination of Rodrigo Rato as Managing Director. As a former Finance Minister, he directed substantial economic progress in Spain and has an excellent understanding of the realities of economic policymaking. We expect Rodrigo Rato will be a strong and skillful leader of the IMF and will focus on continuing to strengthen the institution, to the benefit of all its members.

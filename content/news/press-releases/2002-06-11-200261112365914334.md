Secretary Paul O'Neill joined other senior Bush Administration officials in urging passage of terrorism insurance legislation to mitigate the economic impact of future terrorist events.In a letter to Senate leadership, Secretary O'Neill, National Economic Council Director Lawrence Lindsey, Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels and Council of Economic Advisors Director Glenn Hubbard wrote that the absence of federal legislation is having a palpable and severe effect on our economy and is costing America's workers their jobs.The officials pointed out that more than $7 billion worth of commercial real estate activity has been suspended or cancelled due to the lack of terrorism insurance, and without such insurance, the economic impact of another terrorist attack would be much larger.

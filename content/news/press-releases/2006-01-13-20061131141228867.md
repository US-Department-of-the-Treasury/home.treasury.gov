In a visit to Detroit on Friday. Treasury Secretary John Snow announced the issuance of IRS guidance regarding a tax credit for hybrid vehicles. The credit, which was enacted by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, may be as much as $3,400 for those who purchase the most fuel-efficient vehicles. Snow said that the development and use of hybrid vehicles is a key step toward reducing gasoline consumption, emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. I commend the manufacturers who are making these energy-efficient and environment-friendly vehicles and hope that the President's energy bill proves to be an important step in their rising prominence on American roads

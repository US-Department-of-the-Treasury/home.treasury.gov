​“With today’s bipartisan vote, the Senate took an important step toward restoring emergency unemployment insurance benefits for the next three months while protecting our nation from the economic headwinds the loss of these benefits will create. This vital lifeline was taken away from more than a million Americans at the end of last year, and it is currently causing untold pain for families across the country.


“As high as long-term unemployment is today, we as a nation should be doing everything possible to help these Americans find new jobs. These benefits are central to that effort by allowing responsible job seekers to pay for basic necessities like housing and food. That purchasing power, though, is not just critical for those looking for work and their families. It is also important to local businesses and our economy overall. We are recovering from the worst recession since the Great Depression, and I urge Congress to restore the emergency unemployment insurance benefits that have expired as soon as possible.”​

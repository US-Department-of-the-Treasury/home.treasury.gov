Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control this year issued the Impact Report on Economic Sanctions against Colombian Drug Cartels*, *detailing the illicit activities of 22 Colombian drug cartel principals and organizations that have been targeted by OFAC. The in-depth analysis reviews OFAC's highly effective efforts to expose and isolate significant Colombian narcotics traffickers and their associates and to disrupt and dismantle their business empires. Since it's inception in 1995, the Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers program has been extremely successful in disrupting the financial operations of Colombian drug lords and stripping the cartels of their ill-gotten gains, said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin.

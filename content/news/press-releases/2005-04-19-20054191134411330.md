**Secretary Snow Addresses Mortgage Bankers Association Today** Secretary John Snow today spoke to the Mortgage Bankers Association about the Administration's efforts to simplify the tax code, strengthen Social Security, and make necessary reforms to the regulation of government-sponsored enterprises. Our national system of housing finance needs to remain strong and healthy so that it can continue to make mortgage credit available and provide financing opportunities for new homeowners. The Administration's proposed reforms are intended to ensure greater regulatory oversight, enhanced market discipline, and appropriate capital requirements for the GSEs.

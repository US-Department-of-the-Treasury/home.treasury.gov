JS-384



Tonight, with Senate passage of a bipartisan Jobs & Growth Package, we are one step closer to giving the economy the boost it needs to grow so that millions of Americans can be more secure and confident, both now and in the future.



The Senate bill contains all the elements of the President's plan.  American families will benefit from speeding up the income tax rate reductions, increasing the child credit, and providing marriage penalty relief.  Small businesses will get help by reducing tax rates on owners and entrepreneurs, and by dramatically increasing the amount they can deduct when buying new equipment.  This will create and secure jobs.



I applaud the Senate for taking the bold step of eliminating the unfair double tax on dividends.  Enactment of this proposal will have a profoundly positive effect on job creation, corporate governance, and the well being of all Americans.  It removes a barrier to higher economic growth; it is an investment in the American people and their prosperity.



Americans are anxiously awaiting the outcome.  I urge Congress to quickly get the most robust possible jobs and growth package to the President's desk.

Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey travels to the United Kingdom and Sweden this week to meet with his government counterparts and financial leaders on the threats posed by Iran. Levey's meetings will focus on the implementation of recently-passed UN Security Counsel Resolutions that target Iran's deceptive use of the international financial system to facilitate the regime's proliferation activities.

*TARP Played a Critical Role in Stabilizing the Financial Sector and Restarting Credit Markets, So That Our Nation's Economy Could Recover;*

**WASHINGTON** –On the heels of the recent expiration of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on October 3, the U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the release of a "Two-year Retrospective" report on TARP.

The report provides a comprehensive overview of the steps that Treasury took under TARP to contain a growing financial panic that gripped our country in late 2008 and early 2009. The program played a critical role in recapitalizing the financial sector and restarting the credit markets, which made it possible for businesses, municipalities, and families to borrow again, so that our economy could recover.

According to the report, in light of the recently announced AIG restructuring and when valued at current market prices, Treasury now estimates that the total cost of TARP will be about $50 billion. In addition, using the same assumptions, Treasury estimates that the combined cost of TARP programs and other Treasury interests in AIG will be about $30 billion. (For a full description of cost estimates, please see pages 3-5 of the report.)

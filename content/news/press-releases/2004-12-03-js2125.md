The economy has created more than 2 million jobs so far this year, averaging nearly 200,000 new jobs a month. This is the fifteenth consecutive month of job creation, with the economy adding 112,000 new jobs in November. Falling to 5.4 percent last month, the unemployment rate remains below the average of each of the past three decades.**November's job creation numbers are a confirmation that the American economy is on a steady growth path.

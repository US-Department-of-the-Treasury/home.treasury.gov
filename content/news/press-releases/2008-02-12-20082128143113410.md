Today six of the largest mortgage servicers, representing 50% of the market, announced Project Lifeline – a targeted outreach to homeowners that are 90-days or more delinquent that may lead to a pause in the foreclosure process. This is an important new initiative, targeted to reach not only subprime borrowers, but all 90-day delinquent homeowners nationwide with a step-by-step approach to find individual solutions to individual problems. We encourage all HOPE NOW servicers to adopt this new program, said Paulson.

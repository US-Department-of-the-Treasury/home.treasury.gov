Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. held the second meeting of the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue last week. U.S. and Chinese officials reviewed progress on work plans agreed to at the December meeting and continued discussions in multiple areas. The United States and China understand that getting our economic relationship right is vital not only to our people, but to the world economy. Vice Premier Wu and I see an important part of our job is to communicate frequently, iron out differences, and keep the economic relationship on an even keel, even during times of tension. Our relationship works best when it produces mutual benefits, which lead to growth, balance and a stronger global economy, said Paulson.

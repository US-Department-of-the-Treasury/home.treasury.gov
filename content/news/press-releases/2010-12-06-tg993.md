**Overhauled Treasury.gov Will Increase Openness, Add Cost Saving Technology WASHINGTON –** The U.S. Department of the Treasury today launched the new Treasury.gov, a fully redesigned and overhauled version of the department’s website that will increase Treasury’s abilities to communicate with the public in a transparent and open manner.

“The new Treasury.gov website is a major step forward in our efforts to improve the way citizens access the wealth of data and information Treasury produces on a day-to-day basis,” said Dan Tangherlini, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Management, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Performance Officer.  “For the first time, the new Treasury.gov will use advanced technologies like cloud computing, an official blog, and data visualizations to better communicate and connect with citizens.”

As part of the Obama administration’s efforts to increase openness and transparency in government, the new Treasury.gov site will use some of the latest cutting-edge technologies to significantly improve the department’s online presence.  Notable new improvements include:

- *Cloud Infrastructure*– Treasury is now the first cabinet-level agency to have its website fully hosted in a public “cloud,” a substantially more cost-efficient hosting solution.
- *Content Management System (CMS)*– For the first time, Treasury will be using a content management system to dynamically display information and data on the site.
- *Data Visualizations*– Treasury has deployed an infrastructure that supports interactive data visualizations including[interest rate data](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/Historic-Yield-Data-Visualization.aspx)and[Recovery Act data](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/recovery-act/Pages/Recovery-Act-Data-Visualization.aspx).  With this new infrastructure in place, Treasury will continue to expand its data visualization offerings moving forward.
- *Design and Information Architecture *– The new Treasury.gov design organizes information in a user-centric manner and eliminates the dual site designs that previously existed.
- *Web 2.0*– Treasury has launched its first-ever blog,[Treasury Notes](https://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/default.aspx), and has integrated[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/USTreasGov/),[Twitter](http://twitter.com/USTreasuryDept/),[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ustreasury), and other social networking sites into the new Treasury.gov.
- *Search *– To make the wealth of information that exists on Treasury.gov easy to find, Treasury added FAST search technology so that users can easily get the information they need.

“Treasury’s decision to move its flagship site to a public cloud infrastructure reflects the Administration’s commitment to closing the IT gap between the public and private sectors by leveraging the power of technology,” said Vivek Kundra, Federal Chief Information Officer. “Use of cloud computing increases cost effectiveness, improves efficiency and provides greater flexibility, as the private industry sector has proven. This is exactly the kind of game-changing technology required to do more with less.”

WASHINGTON – U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent issued the following statement upon the House Ways & Means Committee’s successful vote of reconciliation legislation:
“Today, House Republicans continued strong progress toward enacting President Trump’s economic agenda and preventing historic tax hikes on families and businesses,” said Secretary Bessent. “The President’s plan for prosperity is in full swing as a unified Republican Party works to drive economic growth while lowering costs from coast to coast.
“Treasury and Congress are partners in the effort to make the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent while enacting new measures to keep more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans.”

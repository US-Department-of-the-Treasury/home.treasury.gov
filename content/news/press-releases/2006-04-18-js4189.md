**Manchester, NH** Speaking to a group of local Manchester business owners on New England's tax day, U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow today relayed some of the economic benefits of tax relief for the State of New Hampshire.

While tax day is never a day that Americans look forward to, it's always nice when a good plan comes together; and I am delighted to be here, almost three years since the President signed the Jobs & Growth Act, to discuss the fact that because of the tax relief, New Hampshire's economy is strong, stated Snow.  In fact, the unemployment rate here in New Hampshire is at 3.5 percent, which is a significantly lower rate than the state experienced in both the 80's and 90's.  And it's also one of lowest unemployment rates in the country.

In terms of specific tax relief, more than 530,000 New Hampshire taxpayers will be able to live even more free today by enjoying a lighter tax burden from relief like the new ten percent tax bracket and reduction in income tax rates.And businesses like the ones I have been speaking with today are also enjoying tax relief, which is encouraging them to invest more and create jobs, both of which are terrific for economic strength.

Secretary Snow also made clear his position on the importance of Congress making the President's tax relief permanent. It is critical that Congress work to pass legislation that extends tax relief when they return from recess.  Americans cannot afford to revert back to being overtaxed.

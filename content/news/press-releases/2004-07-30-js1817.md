Today's report on GDP growth shows an economy growing at a steady pace. GDP growth over the past two quarters demonstrates the economic progress made by millions of American families and businesses. We're on a positive track and the fundamentals are solid for the future.

Earlier this week we saw consumer confidence reach its highest point in two years demonstrating the strong optimistic spirit of the American people. Home sales continued at high levels in June and durable goods data indicate strength in equipment investment going forward.

Over the past ten months, 1.5 million new jobs have been added to payrolls and unemployment rates are down across the board in all levels of education, race and age.

This is all further evidence that the economic growth and job creation ignited by the President's tax cuts will continue on its current upward path.

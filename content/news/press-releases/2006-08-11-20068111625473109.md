Treasury Secretary Paulson met with market participants today at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. We have a healthy economy in the U.S. and we appear to be making a transition from a level of growth that was seen over the last couple of years and the first quarter to a more sustainable level of growth, he said in an interview from the CBOT. Secretary Paulson also met with small business owners to discuss current economic conditions.

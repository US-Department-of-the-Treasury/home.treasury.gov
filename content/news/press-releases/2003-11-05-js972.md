The United States Senate today took a significant step towards promoting access to credit and financial services for American consumers and implementing tough new safeguards against the spread of identity theft and its devastating effects, implementing Administration proposals that I announced on June 30.

I congratulate the Senate on their action and look forward to working with both Houses of Congress to ensure that the final legislation embodies the goals we all share.

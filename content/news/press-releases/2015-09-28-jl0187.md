​**** **WASHINGTON **– Today at Indiana University’s Indianapolis campus Treasury Deputy Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin participated in a roundtable discussion with undergraduate students focused on their experience with student loans and college affordability.  Deputy Secretary Raskin asked the students to share their views, concerns and suggestions for how to help students succeed during and after college.  Deputy Secretary Raskin reiterated to the students that college affordability remains a top issue for the Obama Administration and that there is an all-hands-on-deck approach across agencies to examine ways the government can play a helpful role in expanding affordable access to higher education and improving outcomes for students borrowers. She highlighted the Administration’s efforts to make it easier for students to apply for aid by simplifying the FAFSA ‎and to ensure that student loan borrowers succeed, including the availability of income driven repayment alternatives.  She closed by restating that Treasury will continue to work with the White House, the Department of Education and other agencies on this issue of critical importance to the nation.      ##​#

Today’s release of retail sales data for March provides us with more evidence that President Bush’s pro-growth economic policies are working. The 1.8 percent increase in retail sales is significant, the biggest monthly increase in a year and more than double the consensus forecast. Today’s release, along with the March employment report, confirm that the President’s policies – especially his decisive action to lower the tax burden on American consumers and businesses – are having a real and positive impact on our economy. We must continue down this path of economic growth, job creation, and prosperity.

We welcome the Export-Import Bank's announcement that it will substantially enhance its short term insurance program in Korea and will explore ways to extend this program to other Asian markets. It is important that this financing is available to promote U.S. exports and jobs in an environment where there is a temporary shortfall in short term trade finance. We also welcome Ex-Im Bank's efforts to work with other export credit agencies to encourage a multilateral initiative to support the region's import financing needs. Such cooperation will be important in broader efforts to restore investor confidence in the region while providing imports that are necessary to return to economic growth and stability.

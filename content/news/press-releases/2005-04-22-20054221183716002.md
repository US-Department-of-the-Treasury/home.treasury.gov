FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

   

I am pleased that the House of Representatives has passed energy legislation that will provide the reliable supplies of energy we need for a growing economy. A dependable energy supply will reduce our reliance on foreign oil and spur economic growth. One of the best things we can do for our economy is to get an energy bill enacted.

Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey delivered remarks and participated in a panel discussion Thursday at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He discussed the Treasury Department's campaign to warn the world about how Iran's threat to our security also poses a threat to the integrity of the international financial system. Financial measures targeted at Iran's nuclear and missile entities and the banks complicit in their misconduct have left Iran financially and politically isolated. International banks have largely scaled back or cut off business with Iran, and Iranian banks are viewed as pariahs in the international financial system. This has intensified a debate in Iran on whether the country's best interests lie in continued defiance and isolation, said Levey.

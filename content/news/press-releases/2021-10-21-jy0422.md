WASHINGTON –  The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced that Secretary Janet L. Yellen will attend the G20 Joint Finance and Health Ministers’ Meeting on October 29 in Rome, Italy; G20 Heads of State and Government Summit on October 30 and 31 in Rome, Italy; attend meetings to further global tax policy priorities in Dublin, Ireland on October 31 and November 1; and represent the U.S. at the UN Climate Change Conference UK (COP26) on November 2 and 3.

While overseas, Secretary Yellen will continue to reinforce the U.S. commitment to multilateralism and advance U.S. policy priorities on global tax policy, climate change, an inclusive economic recovery, and global health.  She will also hold meetings with counterparts, allies, and business leaders.

In addition to representing the U.S. during the G20 meetings and at COP26, Secretary Yellen will also travel to Dublin, Ireland to meet with government officials, and private sector representatives. While in Dublin, Secretary Yellen will focus on the historic OECD/G-20 Inclusive Framework agreement wherein virtually the entire global economy – 136 countries representing 94% of the world’s GDP – have agreed to a new set of international tax rules, including a global minimum tax.

The Secretary is looking forward to continuing working in close cooperation with our allies and multilateral partners to address global challenges.

Additional details and information about possible media opportunities will be announced prior to the trip.

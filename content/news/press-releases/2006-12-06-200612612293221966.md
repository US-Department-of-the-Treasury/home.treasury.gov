The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated nine individuals and two entitiesin the Tri-Border Area of Argentina,Brazil, and Paraguaythat have provided financial and logistical support to the Hizballah terrorist organization. Assad Ahmad Barakat's network in the Tri-Border Area is a major financial artery to Hizballah inLebanon, said Adam Szubin, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Today's action aims to disrupt this channel and to further unravel Barakat's financial network.

This week, as Congress returned to finish the legislative session, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill appeared on C-SPAN's Washington Journal program to push President Bush's economic agenda and to call on Congress to finish Terrorism Risk Insurance, Pension Reform, and Homeland Security.  The Secretary also touched on a variety of other topics including making the President's tax relief permanent, the financial war on terrorism, and corporate ethics and accountability.

Good morning.I would like to thank Professor Apte for this unique opportunity to visit the India Institute of Management.As a former professor and current United States government official, I welcome this chance to talk with students and faculty who share my interest in public policy management and economic development.

As the Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, I frequently speak with officials from ministries of finance and central banks from countries around the world to discuss about the importance of sound fiscal policy.In fact, just yesterday, I had the pleasure of discussing fiscal matters with Finance Minister Chidambaram.Tomorrow, I will meet with Governor Reddy of the Reserve Bank of India in Mumbai.

The fact that I have chosen to speak on this topic in Karnataka a state with a population of 50 million people -- is a reflection of the especially important role that state governments play in Indian fiscal policy.This is similar to my own country, where states also exercise substantial control over budgetary matters.In fact, I advised the Governor of California as a member of the state's Council of Economic Advisors, which addresses many of the same questions that Karnataka and other Indian states face regarding the management of public finances.

Like California, in recent years the government of Karnataka has been facing financial difficulties, which have important implications for the growth of the entire country.Here in southern India, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank are playing a leading role in promoting sound public financial management at the state level.I have been quite impressed with what I have learned so far about Karnataka's progress on budget reform, and understand that several of you at the IIM are actively supporting this effort.I strongly believe this partnership is critical for resolving Karnataka's fiscal challenges, and freeing up resources to support human investment.

Later today, I will be meeting with state finance officials, where I will stress that bringing budgets into balance requires policies to stimulate growth and reduce poverty, both in the rural and urban areas.These policies should not necessarily include subsidies.Rather, the key is to implement measures that generate productivity growth, and provide opportunities to those who have been left behind.I have already witnessed the benefits of productivity-enhancing measures in Upper Pradesh, where I visited a World Bank project designed to introduce farmers to new technology, with tremendous results.

Bangalore's story is a first-rate example of the impact that economic freedom can have on economic growth, and later today I will visit a world-class research and development facility that epitomizes this success.I am confident that with the extension of sound policies to other sectors, including agriculture, the kind of success so powerfully demonstrated in the IT and R&D, will be duplicated.

Thank you.

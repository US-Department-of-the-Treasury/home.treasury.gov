U.S. Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Robert K. Steel will attend a townhall forum hosted by Senator Norm Coleman in Minneapolis, Minn., on Monday, Nov. 19. The Under Secretary will hear firsthand from affected homeowners and discuss a new outreach effort by HOPE NOW, a national alliance of leading counselors, services, and investors working together to educate more homeowners about their mortgage options.

Under Secretary Steel's visit is part of Treasury's broader initiative to help struggling homeowners. U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral has been traveling to some of the hardest hit regions around the country to help homeowners understand their options. Secretary Paulson and U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alfonso Jackson encouraged the creation of HOPE NOW last month and have been working closely with the alliance to help them reach more homeowners.

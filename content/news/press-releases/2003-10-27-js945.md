JS-945



Tax treaty negotiators from Barbados and the United States met last week in Washington, DC to continue discussions to revise the current tax treaty between the two countries.  The aim of these discussions is to ensure that the treaty operates in the manner intended, providing relief from double taxation for cross-border trade and investment between the two countries.  Concluding these revisions is a matter of priority for both governments and the negotiators have agreed to meet again next month to continue their work.

**Washington, DC--** The Treasury Department posted today three solicitations for financial agents to provide services that are needed for the effective implementation of the Troubled Asset Relief Program authorized under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. The three services being sought are:

- [Custodian, Accounting, Auction Management, and Other Infrastructure Services](http://www.treas.gov/initiatives/eesa/docs/notice_custodian-services.pdf)
- [Securities Asset Management Services](http://www.treas.gov/initiatives/eesa/docs/notice_securities-asset-mgr.pdf)
- [Whole Loan Asset Management Services](http://www.treas.gov/initiatives/eesa/docs/notice_whole-loan-asset-mgr.pdf)

All interested and eligible parties that meet the requirements and guidelines required of each service should submit requests by the 5 p.m. (EDT) on Oct. 8, 2008. Treasury expects to announce the results of initial selections from these three competitions next week. In some cases more than one financial agent may be chosen.

These services are being obtained through the Treasury's authority to retain financial agents to provide services on its behalf as provided for under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. These are not contracts governed by the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. More information on Treasury's procurement authorities under this Act can be found at:[http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/hp1179.htm](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp1179).

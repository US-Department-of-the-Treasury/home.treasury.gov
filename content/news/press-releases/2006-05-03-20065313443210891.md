Treasury Secretary John W. Snow participated in a press event on Capitol Hill this morning with Representative Eric Cantor to laud the introduction of Cantor's bill, the Tax Free Health Savings Act of 2006. HSAs are a key component to making health care more affordable and accessible, while at the same putting the consumer in charge of his or her own health care decisions, Snow said. With the help of new legislation like Mr. Cantor's even more Americans will be able to take advantage of these revolutionary health-cost and savings vehicles.

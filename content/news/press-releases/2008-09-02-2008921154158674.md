The Treasury Department continues to remind the over 5 million seniors and veterans who are eligible for a stimulus payment to file a tax return before the October 15 filing deadline. Recently, the Internal Revenue Service announced a summer-long outreach effort to reach millions of seniors and veterans who do not normally file a tax return, but must do so to receive a stimulus payment. The Treasury Department has sent out over 112 million stimulus payments, totaling more than $92 billion, during mass disbursements in May, June and July. Smaller batches of stimulus payments will continue to be sent out as Americans file their tax returns by the October 15 filing deadline.

WASHINGTON – Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo will travel to Paris, France, London, United Kingdom, and Brussels, Belgium from November 7th to 9th to continue close coordination with allies on sanctions against Russia for its brutal war against Ukraine. In meetings with government counterparts, he will follow up on last month’s[convening of countries imposing Russia sanctions and export controls](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1021)to discuss redoubled efforts to deny Putin the revenue and military equipment he needs to further his illegal war. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo will also discuss maintaining strong support for the Ukrainian government and people through direct economic assistance, as well as close coordination on implementing a price cap on Russian oil that will facilitate the flow of Russian oil onto global markets at lower prices and cut into Putin’s main source of revenue.

In Paris and London, Deputy Secretary Adeyemo will meet with private sector executives to hear their perspectives on sanctions evasion and enforcement, as well as the global spillover effects of Putin’s war on higher energy prices and exacerbated food insecurity.

The President



The White House



Washington, D.C. 20500

  

Dear Mr. President:



It has been my privilege and honor to serve you and this great country for the past three years.Unfortunately, I have found it extremely difficult to balance the requirements of the office with time for my family.Consequently, I have concluded that the time has come for me to return to the private sector to allow me to spend more time with them, and I am writing to resign as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy.To allow for a smooth transition, Secretary Snow requested that my resignation be effective after the completion of the fiscal year 2005 budget.



Under your leadership, we have taken important steps toward a tax system consistent with our values and our best interests as a nation.Your principles, your values, and your commitment to doing what is right have resulted in change far beyond the incremental change that too often marks our progress.I am proud of what we have accomplished over the last three years and pleased to have had the opportunity to play a role in promoting policies that have resulted in economic growth and job creation.We have also taken important steps over the last three years to restore the confidence of American taxpayers in the tax system, which was shaken by the excesses of the 1990s.I appreciate the opportunity that I have had to work with the talented staff of the Office of Tax Policy and the Internal Revenue Service to achieve those goals.



May God bless you as you continue to lead ourcountry.



Very truly yours,



Pamela F. Olson

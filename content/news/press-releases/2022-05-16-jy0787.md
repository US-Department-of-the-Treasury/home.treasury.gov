Washington – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for March 2022.  The next release, which will report on data for April, is scheduled for June 15, 2022.

The sum total in March of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $149.2 billion.  Of this, net foreign private inflows were $172.4 billion, and net foreign official outflows were $23.3 billion.

Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in March; net purchases were $20.2 billion.  Net purchases by private foreign investors were $29.4 billion, while net sales by foreign official institutions were $9.2 billion.

U.S. residents decreased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net sales of $2.8 billion.

Taking into account transactions in both foreign and U.S. securities, net foreign purchases of long-term securities were $23.1 billion.  After including adjustments, such as estimates of unrecorded principal payments to foreigners on U.S. asset-backed securities, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $1.8 billion in March.

Foreign residents decreased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $16.4 billion.  Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $12.1 billion.

Banks’ own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased by $135.2 billion.

About TIC Data

The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.  These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.  For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.  The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.  In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.  For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.

The reported division of net purchases of long-term securities between net purchases by foreign official institutions and net purchases

of other foreign investors is subject to a "transaction bias" described in Frequently Asked Questions 7 and 10.a.4 on the TIC website.

/4
 
Net transactions in foreign securities by U.S. residents. Foreign purchases of foreign securities = U.S. sales of foreign securities to foreigners.

Thus negative entries indicate net U.S. purchases of foreign securities, or an outflow of capital from the United States; positive entries

indicate net U.S. sales of foreign securities.

These are primarily data on monthly changes in banks' and broker/dealers' custody liabilities. Data on custody claims are collected

quarterly and published in the TIC website.

/7
 
"Selected Other Liabilities" are primarily the foreign liabilities of U.S. customers that are managed by U.S. banks or broker/dealers.

/8
 
TIC data cover most components of international financial flows, but do not include data on direct investment flows, which are collected

and published by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In addition to the monthly data summarized here, the

TIC collects quarterly data on some banking and nonbanking assets and liabilities. Frequently Asked Question 1 on the TIC website

describes the scope of TIC data collection.

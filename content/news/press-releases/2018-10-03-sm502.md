“This joint statement is part of a broader effort to work closely with our regulatory partners to strengthen the anti-money laundering defenses across the U.S. financial system,” said Sigal Mandelker, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.  “The joint statement allows community-focused banks and credit unions to share certain anti-money laundering resources in order to better protect against illicit actors seeking to abuse those types of institutions.  Such resource sharing must be approached with careful due diligence and thorough consideration of the risks and benefits.”

Among other things, today’s joint statement aims to:

Highlight the potential benefits of collaborative arrangements that pool resources, such as staff, technology, or other resources, to increase operational efficiencies, reduce costs, and leverage specialized expertise; and

Outline risk considerations and mitigation measures associated with the use of collaborative arrangements.

The joint statement acknowledges that banks and credit unions may benefit from using shared resources to manage certain BSA/AML obligations more efficiently and effectively.  However, it notes that financial institutions should approach the establishment of collaborative arrangements like other business decisions, with due diligence and thorough consideration of the risks and benefits.  Banks and credit unions are encouraged to contact their primary federal regulator with questions regarding sharing BSA resources, and should refer to other relevant guidance.

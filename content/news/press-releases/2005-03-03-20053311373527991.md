Secretary John W. Snow is in Fayetteville, AR today to meet with University of Arkansas business students to discuss the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve the Social Security system. Social Security is sound for today's seniors and those nearing retirement, but to keep the promise of Social Security alive for our children and grandchildren, we need to fix the system now, once and for all. The Secretary will be in New Orleans, LA on Friday.

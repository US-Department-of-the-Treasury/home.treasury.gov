In an increasingly global economy, skills and training are important to financial success. The HOPE and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits provide students and parents an opportunity to pay for post-secondary education or job skill training by providing up to $2,000 in tax credits per year. Now, with the school year about to begin, it's important that parents and students know about these important programs that can help further their education.

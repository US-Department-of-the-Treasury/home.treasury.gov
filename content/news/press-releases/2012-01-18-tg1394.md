**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for November 2011.  The next release, which will report on data for December 2011, is scheduled for February 15, 2012.

Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in November — net purchases were $58.0 billion.  Net purchases by private foreign investors were $40.3 billion, and net purchases by foreign official institutions were $17.7 billion.

At the same time, U.S. residents decreased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net sales of $1.9 billion.

Taking into account transactions in both foreign and U.S. securities, the net foreign purchases of long-term securities were $59.8 billion.  After including adjustments, such as estimates of unrecorded principal payments to foreigners on U.S. asset-backed securities, the overall net foreign acquisition of long-term securities is estimated to have been $44.4 billion in November.

Foreigners increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $26.1 billion.  Foreign holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $38.0 billion.

Banks’ own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents decreased by $33.8 billion.

In sum, the net foreign acquisition of long-term securities, the change in foreign holdings of short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows yielded monthly net TIC inflows of $48.6 billion.  Of this, net foreign private inflows were $28.2 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $20.4 billion.

Data on custody claims are collected quarterly and published in the Treasury Bulletin and the TIC website. /7 "Selected Other Liabilities" are primarily the foreign liabilities of U.S. customers that are managed by U.S. banks or broker/dealers. /8 TIC data cover most components of international financial flows, but do not include data on direct investment flows, which are collected and published by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In addition to the monthly data summarized here, the TIC collects quarterly data on some banking and nonbanking assets and liabilities. Frequently Asked Question 1 on the TIC website describes the scope of TIC data collection.

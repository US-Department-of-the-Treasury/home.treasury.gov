U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral will host representatives from Latin America this fall at a Treasury conference to discuss ways to provide the area with better access to banks and other basic financial services. The conference follows on the Treasurer's July trip to El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico to kick off the Latin America initiative. Secretary Paulson discussed his goal of improving the availability of basic financial services in the region in a June speech at the Americas Competitiveness Forum.

​****  **WASHINGTON **- “John Koskinen is an outstanding public servant of the highest integrity with decades of experience leading both public and private institutions. From the day he began his leadership of the IRS, John and his staff have cooperated with Congress.‎ And despite facing massive budget cuts, the IRS continues to carry out its mission of enforcing our nation's tax laws while striving to provide quality service to taxpayers. It is critical that John has the tools he needs to keep his focus on driving the important work the IRS conducts on behalf of the American people.   “Having begun my career working in the House of Representatives, I have deep respect for the institution and believe it should keep its focus on the needs of the American people, not the kind of political agenda that an impeachment vote here would represent.”   ###

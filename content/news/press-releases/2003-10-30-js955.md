Todays report on real GDP in the third quarter shows that the Presidents economic policies are having a positive impact on the economy. The Jobs and Growth Act has put more money in the pockets of American families and helped businesses to make new investments. We are seeing signs of economic recovery: the value of U.S. stock markets has increased $2 trillion since the beginning of this year, disposable personal income is up 3.8 percent at an annual rate in 2003, and the U.S. homeownership rate was 68.4 percent in the third quarter its highest level ever. The GDP report is certainly very encouraging news for our economy, but we still have more work to do to ensure that every American who wants a job can find a job. I look forward to working with the President and Congress to implement additional economic initiatives that will keep the U.S. economy firmly on the road to recovery.

  Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. this morning approved a stimulus payment distribution plan submitted by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico detailing how the Puerto Rican government would send payments to residents of the island.  As required by the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, Puerto Rico had to submit a plan outlining how the government would distribute recovery rebates before a one time payment could be made from the U.S. Treasury to the Puerto Rico Treasury Department.  The final distribution plan, along with the signed approval letter is attached.  **-30- REPORTS**

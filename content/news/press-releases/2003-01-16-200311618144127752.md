The United States welcomes the agreement announced by the Argentine authorities with IMF staff on a Letter of Intent for a transitional IMF program for Argentina.   We look forward to IMF Board consideration of the program in the very near future.    Implementation of an effective transitional program can build on and strengthen the progress Argentina’s authorities are making in stabilizing the country’s economic and financial situation.

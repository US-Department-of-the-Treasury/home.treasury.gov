Trade and foreign investment create jobs, bring healthy competition, encourage companies to innovate and improve, and give consumers a wider variety of choices and lower prices on everything from food to clothes to cars, said Kimmitt. By maintaining open economies and increasing investment opportunities, the United States and the European Union will enhance transatlantic economic ties and strengthen efforts to increase openness around the world that will deliver economic growth and job creation.

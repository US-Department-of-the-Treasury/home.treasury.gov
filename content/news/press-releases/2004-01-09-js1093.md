Following five months of job growth, the unemployment rate fell in December to a 14 month low.  Regardless, today’s report on December job growth demonstrates that while the fundamentals are in place, we must continue our efforts to strengthen the environment for job creation.

The fact is that while an index of manufacturing orders is at a fifty year high, construction spending is up, housing starts are at a twenty year high, retail sales are solid, and GDP growth is strong, the Administration will not be satisfied until every American who wants a job can get one.

We are on the right path to a strong recovery, and we must stay on the path.

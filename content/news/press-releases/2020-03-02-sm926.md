**WASHINGTON** —Today, the U.S. Treasury Department convened a meeting of industry thought leaders and compliance experts to discuss supervisory and regulatory challenges facing digital assets, including cryptocurrency.

“The U.S. welcomes responsible innovation, including new technologies that may improve the efficiency of the financial system,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “We must ensure that we balance innovation with the need to protect our national security and maintain the integrity of our financial system.”

Treasury is focused on preventing the misuse of virtual currencies by money launderers, terrorist financiers, and other bad actors. The United States will continue to be at the forefront of regulating entities that provide cryptocurrency, and will not tolerate the use of cryptocurrencies in support of illicit activities.

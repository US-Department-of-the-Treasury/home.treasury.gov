WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury today filed a Request for Comment (RFC) to seek feedback from the American people on the illicit finance and national security risks posed by digital assets. The filing is pursuant to President Joe Biden’s Executive Order, “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets” and the subsequent Illicit Finance Action Plan released by the  Treasury Department last week.

“Without appropriate controls and enforcement of existing laws, digital assets can pose a significant risk to national security by facilitating illicit finance, such as money laundering, cybercrime and terrorist actions,” U.S. Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson said. “As we work to implement the Illicit Finance Action Plan, hold bad actors accountable and identify potential gaps in existing enforcement, we look forward to receiving the public’s input on this urgent work.”

The full RFC, which will be open for comment through November 3, 2022, can be[viewed here](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA5MTkuNjM5MDUwNzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mZWRlcmFscmVnaXN0ZXIuZ292L3B1YmxpYy1pbnNwZWN0aW9uLzIwMjItMjAyNzkvZW5zdXJpbmctcmVzcG9uc2libGUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtb2YtZGlnaXRhbC1hc3NldHMifQ.QqZwBcrNV-gKCK2ScxgJ0_pg8fDhOFxDHFSIbMJyiCY/s/564424446/br/144241064615-l)

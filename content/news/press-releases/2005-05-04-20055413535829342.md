The Treasury Department today announced its quarterly refunding plans, and said that it would consider reintroducing regular issuance of a 30-year nominal Treasury bond.

We will examine if we have the flexibility to issue 30-year bonds while maintaining deep and liquid markets in our other securities and determine if nominal bond issuance is cost effective, said Assistant Secretary Tim Bitsberger.

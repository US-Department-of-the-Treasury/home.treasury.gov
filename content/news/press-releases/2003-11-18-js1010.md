The 2003 National Money Laundering Strategy continues to expand the framework for identifying, disrupting, and dismantling global terrorist financing and money laundering operations. The Strategy emphasizes the ongoing need for cooperation between the intelligence and law enforcement communities to achieve the common goal of closing off the financial conduits that threaten National Security. Ensuring effective regulation to protect the international financial system remains the paramount objective of the Strategy.

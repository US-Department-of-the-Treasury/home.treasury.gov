Thank you for inviting me to speak here today. The Japan Society is a valuable forum for promoting better understanding and good relations between Japan and the United States. I have benefited from the insights and the activity that the Japan Society has made possible.

America’s alliance with Japan is a centerpiece of President Bush’s foreign policy. I am happy to say that the alliance is as strong as it has ever been. Japan has been a key player in the war against terrorist financing, one of the most successful international cooperation efforts in the financial area in many years. Japan's generous support for the reconstruction of Afghanistan and Iraq has been invaluable.

We are also grateful for Japan’s support in our efforts to raise economic growth around the world. Recently, Japan, the United States, and the other G7 countries agreed on the innovative Agenda for Growth. It is a milestone agreement. Each of the G7 countries identified high priority supply-side reforms to create jobs and raise productivity. Each committed to build on recent reforms by implementing these new measures – and to review progress as part of the regular G7 surveillance process. In the United States, for example, we want to build on the successful tax rate cuts and to implement new policies such as tort reform and saving incentives.

Such reforms are important in all the G7 countries, including the United States. But they are particularly welcome in Japan, because it has struggled economically for more than a decade. Prime Minister Koizumi has embraced structural reforms as the hallmark of his administration.

And things do seem to be changing. The economy has grown for 7 straight quarters, with particularly strong growth this year. The stock market is up 25 percent since the end of March. Banks are reporting increased profits and reductions in bad loans. And there is a rising sense of confidence and optimism among business leaders, officials, and the public.

But many who watch Japan still seem to have a sense of wariness. Previous recoveries—in 1996 and 2000-2001—proved to be short-lived. Is there reason to think that this time is different? That Japan will at last be able to achieve sustained, robust growth?

Fortunately, several factors suggest the current recovery will prove more durable. Perhaps the most important reason for optimism is the new monetary policy the Bank of Japan has put in place. This policy holds the promise of finally eliminating deflation in Japan. For at least 7 years, deflation has been a tremendous drag on the Japanese economy, raising the real value of debts, making the resolution of banking sector problems more difficult, and discouraging consumption and investment. Many factors lead to price changes in the short run, but deflation – a sustained drop in the overall price level – is ultimately a monetary phenomenon.

Economic theory and experience indicates that strong growth in the money supply, maintained over time, is what brings deflation to an end. The Bank of Japan’s shift in March 2001 to a policy of sharply raising base money growth—and maintaining this policy until deflation is eliminated—was therefore a most welcome change. I recall the announcement of this new policy well. It occurred just as I began my current job in the United States government and had to resign my position as foreign adviser to the Bank of Japan. Since that time, steady increases in financial institutions' current account deposits at the Bank of Japan has resulted in 68 percent increase in the monetary base, an average annual growth rate of 22 percent. In addition, good communication with the market from Mr. Fukui has increased market confidence in the Bank of Japan's commitment to end deflation.

There is evidence that the Bank of Japan's more aggressive approach may be starting to pay off. Consumer prices excluding fresh food rose for the first time in over 5 years in October. But it is still too early to declare victory in Japan's long struggle against deflation. Some of the apparent easing of deflation is due to special factors that have increased prices this year.

I agree with those that say the Bank of Japan should wait some time before raising interest rates above zero and abandoning its current policy of strong monetary base increases. Inflation is barely positive. It is still well below common measures of price stability. There is still excess capacity. Standard monetary policy guidelines suggest that the interest rate should be held at zero until price stability is more firmly established and output grows much closer to potential. Both will take time.

Fortunately, the Bank of Japan recognizes that the time has not yet come to abandon its anti-deflation efforts. In October, the Monetary Policy Board judiciously assured the markets that its current policy will continue until deflation is clearly in the past.

Another key reason for optimism about the sustainability of the current recovery is the recent progress in bank and corporate sector reforms. The resolution of Ahikaga Bank and Resona Bank are genuine signs of progress. Those actions showed that last year's measures to improve the valuation of bank assets and capital are effective, and that Japan's regulators and auditors can and will resist political pressures to go easy on the banks. They demonstrated the Japanese authorities' ability to move quickly and effectively to resolve weak banks, while avoiding financial and economic disruption. Perhaps most important, replacing top management and imposing costs on shareholders showed the government's commitment to setting the right incentives—a key to achieving a longer-term solution to the banking system's problems.

On the corporate side, firms have strengthened their balance sheets by paying down debt. They have cut costs and increased operating margins, even in the midst of deflation. They have begun to restructure to focus more on their core strengths. Listed companies have begun to pay more attention to shareholders and rates of return. As a result of these efforts, corporate profits have increased sharply, supporting future investment and growth.

Another good sign is that, unlike past recoveries that depended heavily on public works spending, this time growth has been led by the private sector. From 1992 to 2000, the Japanese Government spent over $1 trillion in stimulus packages to jump-start recovery. These did not bring about sustained growth, but they did leave Japan with a huge deficit and the largest public debt of any G7 country. This time is different. Government spending, and public works spending in particular, has fallen during the current recovery.

Not all indicators are positive, of course. Japanese economic prospects are still highly dependent on exports. For a durable recovery, Japan needs more balanced growth where domestic spending grows with income. This is why the structural reform and deregulation agenda of the Koizumi administration is so important. It has the potential to open up new opportunities for investment and growth. The deregulation of the domestic mobile phone industry in the mid-1990’s, which spurred demand for base station and transmission facilities as well as for handsets, is a clear example of deregulation's power to spur domestic activity. Similar opportunities exist in health care and care for the elderly, housing, and a host of domestic services.

Progress in retail deregulation has allowed far more competition, with benefits for consumers and the economy as a whole. Many medical services businesses have been deregulated. And there has been progress in IT deregulation.

 

I hope we can look forward to more progress, such as the reduction in regulatory barriers that continue to limit competition in many economic sectors, including transportation and food processing.

Continued reforms will also be useful to increase new firm creation and entrepreneurial activity in Japan. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor listed Japan last among 37 countries in its 2002 Total Entrepreneurial Activity Index. Japan was also near the bottom of those indexes, which are based on the percentage of the working age population involved in starting a new business, or an owner/manager of a business that is less than 42 months old, in previous years. Removing regulatory barriers to competition can help, as will the emergence of a healthier financial system that is better able to support entrepreneurial activity.

The key to taking advantage of these opportunities is economic flexibility – the ability to respond to price signals both in the domestic and world economy, and to shift resources to most productive uses. The reforms Prime Minister Koizumi is pursuing will help promote the economic flexibility needed to take advantage of those opportunities.

Flexible exchange rate regimes among the world's major trading countries are a key part of maintaining economic flexibility. That is why we have entered discussions with China—an increasingly important trading partner for Japan and the United States—about the steps needed to pursue their announced goal of moving toward a more flexible exchange rate regime.

And while Japan has made progress in dealing with its banking sector problems, non-performing loans are still a problem. It is true that bank profits rose sharply in the first half of this year, but some of this was due to gains on stock holdings and to tax rebates from the Tokyo municipal government. Solid profitability on core business operations of banks still has to be established.

Japan now has much of the legal and institutional infrastructure needed for corporate restructuring, and the workout process for distressed, over-indebted borrowers is beginning. But incentives are still skewed towards rolling over debt and postponing borrower problems. Unresolved loan claims have created an overhang of land, capital, and labor locked in unproductive activities that blocks resource mobility and discourages investment. I have argued in the past that ending the deflation problem will help improve incentives because positive interest rates will reduce incentives for debt rollover.

As I mentioned, policymakers in Japan now recognize that fiscal stimulus is not the key to sustained growth. The Koizumi administration has changed the way in which people view government spending. It has also framed the debate in realistic terms – how to achieve a primary budget balance over time. There is now a very healthy debate going on in Japan on how to meet public pension obligations and limit the rise in the contribution ratio – a debate that was spurred on by the recent election campaign.

A credible, transparent multi-year framework for restoring public finances would do much to ease the pain of fiscal consolidation in Japan, and increase the public’s confidence in the future.

In sum, there are clear signs that things have changed in Japan. The building blocks for sustained, robust economic growth are being established. Further reform efforts will be needed across the spectrum of economic policy to ensure stronger growth. As the Koizumi Government continues to implement banking, regulatory, and other reform measures, a brighter economic future is in store.

Treasury has become aware of phony e-mail messages claiming to come from Department officials. These messages are a hoax designed to trick victims into revealing confidential information. The Treasury Department does not send unsolicited requests and does not seek personal or financial information from members of the public by e-mail and recommends that recipients not respond to such messages.

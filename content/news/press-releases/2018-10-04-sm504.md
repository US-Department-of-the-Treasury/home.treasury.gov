**Washington**– Today President Donald J. Trump and the National Security Council announced the Administration’s new National Strategy for Counterterrorism. Below is a statement from Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin in response to the new strategy:



“President Trump’s new National Strategy for Counterterrorism will harden the U.S. financial system against terrorist threats and promote collaboration with allies to counter international terror financing networks. Treasury employs a broad array of tools to help disrupt terrorist attacks without putting our troops in harm’s way, and this Administration has accelerated efforts to shut down networks that terrorists use to finance their operations. Treasury will continue to apply sustained pressure on ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Hizballah and other Iran-sponsored proxies, Lashkar-E Tayyiba, and other terrorist organizations.”

“I am pleased the President has nominated John Koskinen to be the next Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. With a distinguished record of turning around large companies and reorganizing the management and operations of highly complex public and private institutions, John is the right person to take on this critical position at this important time. Because John has a clear understanding of how to make organizations more effective and an unshakeable commitment to public service, he will be an exceptional leader who will strengthen the institution and restore confidence in the IRS. John is a man of the highest integrity, and I want to thank him for agreeing to return to public life and serve his country again after a long and accomplished career. I urge the Senate to confirm this nomination quickly.

 

“If confirmed, John will build on the extraordinary work of Danny Werfel.  Danny is an outstanding public servant who has done a remarkable job of putting the IRS on a stronger footing in just a matter of months.  He has improved the agency’s operations, and he has paved the way so that the IRS can meet its fundamental obligation to provide fair, high-quality service to taxpayers.”

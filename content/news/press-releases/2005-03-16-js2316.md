On behalf of the Treasury Department, I offer the deepest condolences to the family of John Linton, a veteran of nearly 17 years of service to the U.S. Treasury. John served honorably in Treasury's Office of Tax Policy, and news of his death came as a blow to that office, as well as to the extended Treasury family.

Among his many accomplishments at Treasury, John's work on tax-related database and modeling projects helped save and preserve over 30 years' worth of invaluable tax and economic data.

We wish his family comfort; John will be profoundly missed.

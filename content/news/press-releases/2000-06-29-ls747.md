FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-747



This April, President Clinton proposed a plan that would provide comprehensive consumer financial privacy protection for all Americans.



Today, a bipartisan House Banking Committee passed a bill based largely on the medical privacy provisions of the President's legislation. We believe, however, that Congress should extend protections to other consumer financial information, including consumers' personal spending habits.



We hope that Congress will complete the job the Banking Committee began today by passing this year the privacy protections American's expect and deserve.

**Washington-** Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Robert K. Steel made the following statement today regarding the release of new HOPE NOW guidelines to provide help to homeowners quickly and to deal with issues surrounding second mortgages and short sales.

 

The HOPE NOW procedures announced today will allow even more homeowners to get help faster. We are pleased to see the alliance members continually making improvements and expect them to maintain their efforts. As we have said, there is no one silver bullet to address every housing challenge, but if we continue pursuing a series of measures and initiatives, we can have a maximum impact.

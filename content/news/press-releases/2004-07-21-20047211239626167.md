Congress has an historic opportunity before them to keep our economic recovery on track and prevent a tax increase on the nearly 94 million people who benefit from the lowest 10% bracket, the increased child credit, marriage penalty relief and alternative minimum tax relief (AMT). These provisions, enacted in the Jobs & Growth Tax Relief Act of 2003, expire at the end of the year. If Congress fails to extend them, millions of hardworking Americans and their families will see less money in their take-home pay and feel the pinch in their pocketbooks.Click here for Snow's speech

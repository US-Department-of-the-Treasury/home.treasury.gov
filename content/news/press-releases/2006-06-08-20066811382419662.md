Treasury Secretary Snow joined his G8 counterparts this weekend to participate in a meeting of the Finance Ministers in St. Petersburg, Russia. At the conclusion of the weekend's meetings Secretary Snow said, As I reflect on the last 3 ½ years I've represented the United States in the G-8, the global economy has enjoyed remarkable success – with high levels of global growth, historically low levels of inflation and interest rates and no major financial crises or recessions. It is especially significant that we are seeing more rapid levels of growth in the developing economies. There is no better time for our economies to put in place policies that will sustain growth and improve living standards for all people.

**WASHINGTON, DC--** The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated German national Bekkay Harrach, an al-Qa'ida member believed to be currently located in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, for acting for or on behalf of al-Qa'ida.Today's action, pursuant to Executive Order 13224, freezes any assets Bekkay Harrach has under U.S. jurisdiction, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transactions with Harrach.

Harrach's activities are a stark reminder thatal-Qa'idacontinues to attempt to terrorize the German people and others involved in the fight against terrorism, said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin.  The international community must redouble its efforts to use all tools – including the United Nations' powerful sanctions – to thwart al-Qa'ida's objectives.

According to investigations by the German Federal Public Prosecutor, there is reason to believe that Bekkay Harrach has been a member ofal-Qa'idasince March 2007, during which time he received military training at anal-Qa'idacamp.In addition, he has made threats regarding terrorist activities and suicide attacks that were distributed in Germany via theal-Qa'idamedia office.

BekkayHarrach was added to the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee's Consolidated List of individuals and entities associated withal-Qa'ida, Usama bin Laden, and the Taliban in May 2009.Inclusion on the 1267 Committee's list triggers international obligations on all member countries, requiring them to freeze the funds and other assets of listed individuals and entities and to apply other sanctions, including a travel ban and an arms embargo.

Additional information onBekkayHarrach is provided in the public statement of the case supporting his inclusion on the 1267 Committee's Consolidated list and is available at[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/sc9667.doc.htm](http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/sc9667.doc.htm).

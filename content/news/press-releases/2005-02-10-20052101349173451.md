Secretary Snow this week testifies before Congress on the President's fiscal year 2006 budget. By focusing on priorities and looking for savings in every agency, across the board, the President's administration has come up with a budget that we believe is fair while also holding the government accountable, he said to the Senate Budget Committee today. As the President announced in his State of the Union Address last week, this budget adheres to the principle of 'Taxpayer dollars must be spent wisely, or not at all.'

The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, today, issued a Federal Register Notice explaining the requirements and procedures to establish eligibility for payments under the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. The Notice is available for public inspection at the Federal Register, and it will be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday, November 22, 2000.



The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 directs the Secretary of the Treasury to make payments to persons who hold certain categories of judgments against Cuba or Iran in suits brought under 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(7) based on terrorist acts. On November 1, 2000, the Treasury Department published a notice in the Federal Register advising that it would shortly prescribe procedures to establish eligibility for these payments.

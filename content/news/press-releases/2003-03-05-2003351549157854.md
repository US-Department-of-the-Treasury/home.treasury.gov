Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and U.S. Treasurer Rosario Marin today provided their signatures to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing for use on Series 2003 U.S. paper currency. 

The signatures of Secretary Snow and Treasurer Marin will be transferred by the BEP’s engravers to steel plates, which will be used to print all new U.S. notes.



The BEP expects to begin production of $1 Series 2003 Snow-Marin notes by April 2003 once the engraved plates are completed. The paper currency is expected to be sent to the Federal Reserve by July 2003 for distribution as needed.

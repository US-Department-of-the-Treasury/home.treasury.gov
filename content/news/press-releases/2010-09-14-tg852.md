**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the following statement from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner ontoday's Senate cloture vote for the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010.

The Senate, under the leadership of Senators Reid, Baucus, and Landrieu, has taken a vital step forward to help provide small businesses with the critical support they need to expand and hire in their local communities. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and a critical source for growth. This common sense legislation to provide targeted tax cuts and increase lending will help spur the creation of private sector jobs and strengthen our nation's recovery. I urge the Senate and House to move quickly to deliver legislation to President Obama's desk for his signature as soon as possible.

In testimony on the President's FY 2007 Budget yesterday morning, Secretary John Snow argued for permanency of the President's tax relief, saying that there can be no question today that well-timed tax relief, combined with responsible leadership from the Federal Reserve Board, created an environment in which small businesses, entrepreneurs and workers could bring our economy back from its weakened state of just a few years ago. Tax relief encouraged investment, which has ultimately led to job growth. The American economy is now unmistakably in a trend of expansion, and those trend lines can clearly be traced to the enactment of the tax relief.

Treasury Secretary John Snow and Commerce Secretary Don Evans today praised the passage of legislation by the U.S. House of Representatives that would permanently extend the moratorium on taxes on Internet access and multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.



A permanent moratorium means a permanent victory for American consumers and businesses.  Keeping the Internet free of multiple or discriminatory taxes will help create an environment for innovation and will help ensure that electronic commerce remains a vital, and growing, part of our economy.



The House Leadership deserves much credit for getting this legislation passed.  The Departments of Commerce and Treasury will continue to pursue this issue to make sure a permanent moratorium is available for President Bush to sign by the November 1 deadline.

The Treasury Department announced today that the United States and the Republic of Malta have signed a new income tax treaty. In a ceremony in the Maltese capital of Valletta, U.S. Ambassador to Malta Molly Bordonaro and Maltese Finance Minister Tonio Fenech signed a treaty that reduced withholding rates on cross-border dividend payments generally with the elimination of withholding on cross-border dividend payments to pension funds. It also generally provides for withholding at a 10-percent rate on interest, royalties, and other income.

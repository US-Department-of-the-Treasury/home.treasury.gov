In an ongoing effort to ensure U.S. businesses and workers remain competitive in the ever growing global economy, Secretary Paulson hosted a one-day conference in July to examine how our system of business taxation affects competitiveness.  Hearing a wide range of ideas and opinions from leading businessmen and women, economists and policy makers, Secretary Paulson along with Treasury staff are now working through those comments and putting together next steps.

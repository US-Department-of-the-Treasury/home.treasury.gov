We, the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, have today agreed on an Agenda for Growth. This Agenda follows the successful cooperative approach of our two recent G7 Action Plans the October 2001 Action Plan on Terrorist Financing and the April 2002 Action Plan on Emerging Markets in which we defined objectives and then reported on progress toward those objectives at subsequent meetings.

The Administration released the year-end budget results for Fiscal Year 2007 on Thursday. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. said, This year's budget results demonstrate the remarkable strength of the U.S. economy. This strength has translated into record-breaking revenues flowing into the U.S. Treasury and a continued decline in the federal budget deficit. President Bush's fiscal policies have helped promote economic growth and steady job creation.

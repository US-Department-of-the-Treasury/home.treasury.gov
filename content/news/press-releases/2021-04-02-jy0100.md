For the last few years, Ken Blanco has been one of the most important public servants that you’ve likely  never heard of. That’s because Ken has been engaged in the often unseen work of disrupting illicit finance, the funding of crimes and terrorism.

Ken has taken important steps to modernize FinCEN, and his effort to bring more diversity to the organization and collaborate inside and outside of Treasury have put FinCEN on strong footing. I’m grateful for Ken’s leadership and look forward to working with Acting Director Michael Mosier to carry on important anti-money laundering and anti-corruption work, including full implementation of the landmark legislation passed by Congress earlier this year.

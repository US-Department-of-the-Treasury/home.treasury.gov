​**WASHINGTON** – Nathan Sheets was confirmed by the United States Senate today to serve as the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Under Secretary for International Affairs.  In this role, Sheets will lead Treasury's Office of International Affairs, which protects and supports U.S. economic prosperity by strengthening the external environment for U.S. growth, preventing and mitigating global financial instability, and managing key global challenges.   “Nathan's distinguished career in both the public sector and private sector will be invaluable to the administration at this important moment for the global economy,” said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew.  “We must continue to build on the significant progress that has been made in strengthening our economy, and Nathan will play a key role in our continued efforts to promote growth and to level the playing field for American workers and firms.”   Prior to joining Treasury, Sheets was the Global Head of International Economics at Citigroup, a position he held since September 2011.  Prior to joining Citigroup, Sheets worked at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for 18 years, where he worked closely with his international counterparts, including as Director of the Board’s Division of International Finance and Economist to the Federal Open Market Committee.  From 2006 to 2007, while on leave from the Federal Reserve, he served as a Senior Advisor to the U.S. Executive Director of the International Monetary Fund.    Sheets received a B.A. from Brigham Young University and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   *###*

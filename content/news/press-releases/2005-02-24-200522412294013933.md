Secretary John W. Snow is in Jacksonville, Florida on Friday to speak with local business leaders at the Jacksonville Chamber of Commerce about the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve the Social Security system. Social Security is sound for today's seniors and those nearing retirement, but to keep the promise of Social Security alive for our children and grandchildren, we need to fix the system now, once and for all, he said.

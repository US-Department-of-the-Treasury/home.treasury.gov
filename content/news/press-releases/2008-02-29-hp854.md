HP-854

 

Today's signing of the Andean Trade Preference Act is an important bridge as we work with Congress to pass the Colombia Free Trade Agreement and as we implement the Peru Free Trade Agreement.

I thank all the members of Congress who supported this bipartisan legislation, and I look forward to working with Congress to further enhance opportunities for American workers and American businesses by passing the Free Trade Agreements with Colombia and Panama.

The Colombia FTA will not only create jobs in the United States and give American companies important access to markets in Colombia, but will also be an important stabilizing force for democracy and economic progress in the region.

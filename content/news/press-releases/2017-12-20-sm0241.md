“Today Congress delivered tax cuts to middle-income families and a level playing field for American businesses.  I congratulate the House and Senate for passing this historic legislation, which will usher in higher wages and more jobs for American workers, a fairer system for all, and greater economic growth that will lead to a brighter and more secure future for our country.  Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and our colleagues in Congress, hardworking Americans will keep more of their hard-earned money in 2018 and beyond.”

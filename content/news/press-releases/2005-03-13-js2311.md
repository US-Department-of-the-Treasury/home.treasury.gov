Treasury's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Education Dan Iannicola, Jr. today addressed high school teachers from across the country at a National Academy Foundation meeting in Baltimore, Maryland. Iannicola shared best practices in financial education with the teachers and explained techniques for integrating personal finance topics into existing curricula. Iannicola also shared information on financial education resources including[www.mymoney.gov](http://www.mymoney.gov/).



The teachers I met today are committed to bettering their students' futures. We spoke about how they can do just that by bringing personal finance topics into their high school classrooms, said Iannicola. The National Academy Foundation is to be commended for their support of teachers like these.



The mission of the National Academy of Finance is to sustain a national network of career academies to support the development of America's youth toward personal and professional success in higher education and throughout their careers. The National Academy of Finance focuses on preparing young people for future careers through a combination of school-based curricula and work-base experiences.



The Department of the Treasury is a leader in promoting financial education.  Treasury established the Office of Financial Education in May of 2002. The Office works to promote access to the financial education tools that can help all Americans make wiser choices in all areas of personal financial management, with a special emphasis on saving, credit management, home ownership and retirement planning.  The Office also coordinates the efforts of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission, a group chaired by the Secretary of Treasury and composed of representatives from 20 federal departments, agencies and commissions, which works to improve financial literacy and education for people throughout the United States.  For more information about the Office of Financial Education visit:[www.treas.gov/financialeducation](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/financial-education).

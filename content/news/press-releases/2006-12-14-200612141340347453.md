Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson and a delegation of Administration officials are in Beijing for the inaugural meeting of the U.S. – China Strategic Economic Dialogue. The Dialogue should help us manage and address the most important long term issues facing our two nations while providing a forum to address the most pressing short term issues, Paulson said. Secretary Paulson is joined by Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt, Energy Secretary Sam Bodman, U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson, and other Administration officials.  In addition, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.

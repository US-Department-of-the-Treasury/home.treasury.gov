President George W. Bush has summoned lawmakers to the White House today to urge them to provide federal backing of terrorism insurance needed to jump- start stalled construction projects across the nation.   Secretary O’Neill, who is attending the event at the White House with President Bush, said last week that, “I think the terrorist risk insurance legislation could have the quickest most profound effect on job creation in our country of anything we could imagine to do.  If I would identify one thing I'd like to have right now that can make a big difference to unleashing job creation in the United States, it's the Terrorist Risk Insurance Bill.  That's what we need to do, and we need to do it right now.

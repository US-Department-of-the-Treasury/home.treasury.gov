Washington- Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. made the following statement today regarding the resignation of Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Robert K. Steel and the broader role that Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets Anthony W. Ryan will take on in the Department.

Bob Steel has been a friend and colleague to me for more than 30 years. He has served the President and the public with ingenuity and dedication during extraordinary times in our financial markets. I know he will excel in his future endeavors, said Secretary Paulson.

Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets Anthony W. Ryan will take on a broader role managing Treasury's domestic finance and financial markets agenda. Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions David Nason will continue to spearhead regulatory reform efforts and oversee financial institutions policy, including issues surrounding the government sponsored enterprises. Steven Shafran, who had 22 years of experience in finance before coming to Treasury, will take on a broader role in his current capacity as Senior Adviser to the Secretary. Assistant Secretary Kenneth Carfine will continue to oversee the government's fiscal operations, including managing federal financing needs and the government's cash flow. Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Policy Jeremiah Norton will take on additional financial institutions responsibilities.

I have great confidence in the abilities of the Domestic Finance team at Treasury to adjust to this change and not miss a beat, said Secretary Paulson.

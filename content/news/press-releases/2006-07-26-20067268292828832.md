The Treasury Department's Office of Tax Analysis released its report entitled, A Dynamic Analysis of Permanent Extension of the President's Tax Relief. Aside from explaining and providing a more in-depth, transparent understanding of dynamic analysis, the report illustrates the positive contributions the tax relief, together with spending reductions, can be expected to make to the U.S. economy. In addition, the analysis shows the importance of making the tax provisions permanent for the U.S. economy's long-term economic growth.

We welcome the initiatives by the Argentine authorities to strengthen Argentina's economic policy framework working with the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. In the context of that strengthened policy framework, we will be prepared to support an enhanced program of financial assistance by those institutions with the objective of promoting economic growth in Argentina and improving its access to capital markets.

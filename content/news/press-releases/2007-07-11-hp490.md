**Washington****, ****D.C.**– U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Robert M. Kimmitt made the following statement upon passage of the legislation to reform the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States:



The Foreign Investment and National Security Act is a well-balanced bill, and I commend this bipartisan effort by the Congress.  This bill updates the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and strikes the important balance between protecting national security in a post-9/11 world and advancing the open investment policy set out by President Bush on May 10 of this year.

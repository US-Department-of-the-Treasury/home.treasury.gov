Treasury Secretary Paulson participates today in the inaugural Americas Competitiveness Forum hosted by Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez in Atlanta. Paulson announced a new initiative today to expand lending to small businesses that currently have little access to financing. The United States is committed to helping Latin America reduce poverty, fight corruption, build the middle class, and generate more opportunities for people who feel excluded from the region's growing prosperity, said Paulson.

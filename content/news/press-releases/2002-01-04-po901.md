Today's unemployment figures show that millions of dislocated workers are suffering from our slow economy. We must take steps to speed our recovery and put Americans back to work. I'm glad the Senate Majority Leader said today he agreed with the President that we should work together to create jobs. I look forward to working with the Senate leader to secure passage of legislation to help dislocated workers and to cut taxes so employers can create more jobs. Creating jobs and getting the economy growing again is the surest path back to Washington budget surpluses.

We welcome the substantial policy measures announced today by the Japanese government. These are positive steps. We hope the government will put these measures into place quickly and effectively and move forward with further actions, including measures to strengthen Japan's financial system and open and deregulate its economy, to help establish a sound basis for long-lasting, domestic-demand-led growth. The whole world, including Japan's Asian neighbors, has a strong interest in seeing Japan succeed in generating a strong domestic recovery that will contribute to recovery in Asia.

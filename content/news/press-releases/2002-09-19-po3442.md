Strategies for spurring economic growth in the Americas will be the focus when Finance Ministers of the Western Hemisphere nations meet later this month in Washington.

Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill will host the meeting on the morning of Friday, September 27, 2002. Invitations have been extended to 34 Finance Ministers in the hemisphere.

This meeting will give us an opportunity to discuss recent economic developments and the policy responses needed to increase economic growth and improve financial stability, said Secretary O’Neill. We have an obligation to do everything we can to increase economic growth and improve the standard of living for people in our hemisphere.

The meeting agenda will include sessions on increasing productivity growth, improving financial stability, and promoting regional integration – especially the gains from trade.

 

Secretary O’Neill intends for the meeting to produce a frank and open discussion of economic issues affecting the hemisphere.

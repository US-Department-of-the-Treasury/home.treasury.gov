Secretary Paulson continues to work with Congressional leaders to find a way forward to pass a comprehensive plan to stabilize our financial system and protect the American people by limiting the prospects of further deterioration in our economy. Markets around the world are under stress, and that reduces the availability of credit that businesses across America depend on to meet payroll and to purchase inventories. Families, too, feel the credit crunch as it becomes more difficult to get car loans or a student loan, said Paulson. We've got much work to do. This is much too important to simply let fail.

The President's bipartisan panel on tax reform, announced today, brings together some of our nation's brightest minds.  Reforming our tax code to give Americans a tax system that fosters economic growth and is fairer and simpler will be a historic effort.  I look forward to working with this group of extraordinarily distinguished individuals to make recommendations to help achieve this important goal.

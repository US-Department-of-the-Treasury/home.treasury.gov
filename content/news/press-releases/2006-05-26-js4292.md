In his long career in the House of Representatives, Connecticut Congressman Robert Giaimo served well the people of his district. Through efforts such as his support to create the National Endowment for the Arts, his contribution to DC's Metro system and as a champion of fiscal restraint while chairing the House Budget Committee he also made significant and lasting contributions to Americans nationwide. He was a good friend and my thoughts and prayers are with his family.

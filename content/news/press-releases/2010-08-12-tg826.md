  **WASHINGTON** – Today, the Obama Administration announced additional details about its August 17 *Conference on the Future of Housing Finance*, including a list of panelists and the conference agenda. This event will provide a forum for public input as the Administration continues its work developing a comprehensive housing finance reform proposal for delivery to Congress by January 2011. Across the spectrum, stakeholders agree that our current system of housing finance requires fundamental reform, said Jeffrey A. Goldstein, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance. This conference is an opportunity for us to broaden our perspectives on a number of key issues in a transparent way to make certain that all of the best ideas are on the table. This conference is an opportunity to engage stakeholders and experts with broad knowledge and many perspectives, said Dr. Raphael Bostic, HUD Assistant Secretary for Policy Development and Research. It is part of our larger effort to make sure that we have a deep and wide understanding of these issues as we chart a thoughtful, sound path forward in reforming our housing finance system. During the conference, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan will moderate panel discussions with a diverse group of experts about the critical issues surrounding housing finance reform. These panelists represent a cross-section of stakeholder groups with interests in the outcome of this reform process, including citizen advocacy groups, economists, investors, market researchers, originators, securitizers, servicers, and private mortgage insurers.

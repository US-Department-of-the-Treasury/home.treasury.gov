The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated seven Egyptian individuals pursuant to Executive Order 13224 for acting for and on behalf of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), a terrorist group that merged with al Qaida in 2001.This action targets the financing mechanisms used by those rogue actors supporting al Qaida, said Robert Werner, Director of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Designations are central to identifying and disrupting the support networks fueling al Qaida's agenda.The activities of these individuals included training and providing material support to al Qaida, as well as conspiring to commit terrorist acts.  One of the individuals, Madhat Mursi Al-Sayyid Umar, was an explosives and chemical substances specialist for al Qaida.  Another designee, Abdullah Muhammad Rajab Abd Al-Rahman, was responsible for coordinating al Qaida's work with other terrorist organizations.These individuals are wanted by Egyptian authorities for their involvement in terrorist cases and membership in a terrorist organization.The United States is taking this action pursuant to United Nations Security Counsel Resolution 1617, which requires member states to financially isolate individuals and entities added to the UN 1267 Committee's consolidated list of terrorists tied to the Taliban, al Qaida and UBL.

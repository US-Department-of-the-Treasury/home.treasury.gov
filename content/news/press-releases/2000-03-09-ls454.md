FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-454



We took another step today in paying down the debt with our first buyback of $1 billion of outstanding government securities. This is an important milestone in the management of our debt and represents the first U.S. government buyback operation in 70 years. It is a sign of the success of the Administration's economic policies.



Buyback operations are an important debt management tool that can reduce the cost to the American taxpayer. We were pleased with the success of today's operation.

Secretary Paulson testifies today before the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance.  The President has submitted a budget that reflects our strong economy and our nation's priorities: continued job creation and wage growth, vigorous prosecution of the war on terror, increased access to affordable health insurance, improved energy security, and a strong fiscal position from which we can address long-term challenges such as strengthening Social Security and Medicare for future generations, said Paulson.

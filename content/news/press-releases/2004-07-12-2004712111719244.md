Ohio-born Treasury Secretary John Snow will visit Cleveland, Ohio on Tuesday to meet with a local business and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. As a result of the President's economic policies, more than 1.5 million new U.S. jobs have been created since August 2003, said Secretary Snow. Ohio has gained more than 30,000 new jobs so far this year.

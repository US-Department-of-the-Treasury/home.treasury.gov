The Treasury Department today announced that beginning January 13, 2003, it will begin releasing the official results of Treasury bill and note auctions electronically to accredited news services and the public.



Automating this process is an important step forward in our effort to achieve a consistent two-minute release of Treasury auction results to the market, said Peter Fisher, Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance.



The results will be posted to a special Internet site for automated retrieval by the news services. Auction results will also be posted on the Bureau of the Public Debt's public website as quickly as possible thereafter. The official release time of Treasury bill and note auctions will be the time the auction results data is made available to the news services on the special Internet site.

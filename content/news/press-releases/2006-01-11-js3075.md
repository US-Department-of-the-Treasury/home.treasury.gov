Treasury Secretary John W. Snow named Larry R. Felix as the director of Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP). The Bureau produces U.S. currency and other government securities and documents at its two facilities in Washington, D.C., and Fort Worth, Texas.

As BEP director, Felix will work to meet the challenges of the advancements in technology that pose evolving threats to our nation's currency and other security documents to stay ahead of counterfeiters, and to protect the integrity of U.S. currency. In addition, Felix will work to ensure that the bureau's resources are appropriate to meet requirements of customer agencies.

A 23-year career Treasury employee, Felix has spent the last 13 years at BEP most recently as Deputy Director. He previously served as BEP's associate director (technology) and chief of external relations. He also chaired the Inter-agency Currency Design (ICD) taskforce, a group responsible for recommending technical enhancements to U.S. currency design.

Felix has degrees from the New York City College of Technology and the City College of New York and did PhD work at Columbia University. Born in Port of Spain, he grew up in New York City and currently resides with his wife and two daughters in Virginia.

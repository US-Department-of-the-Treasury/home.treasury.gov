I deeply appreciate the work Carole Brookins has done in representing the Bush Administration on the executive board of the World Bank for nearly four years.In this role, Carole has been a tireless and effective advocate for our reform efforts.Because of her work, World Bank programs are better able to serve the needs of the world's poorest citizens.I particularly want to recognize the role Carole played in encouraging the Bank to focus attention on private sector development and the creation of strong investment climates in developing countries.Carole played a leading role in developing collaborative programs between the World Bank's International Development Agency (IDA) and the International Finance Corporation, providing critical support to small enterprise development in sub-Saharan Africa.She also helped in achieving President Bush's initiatives to deliver IDA assistance in the form of grants instead of loans, and to adopt results-based measurement programs.In addition, Carole was a consistent advocate of partnering the private and public sectors to develop infrastructure in the poorest countries.Her service at the Bank on behalf of President Bush will be noted for her determination to ensure that scarce development resources are used effectively and efficiently to lift people out of poverty.I wish Carole the best as she moves on to new challenges.

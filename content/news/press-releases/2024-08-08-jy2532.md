WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen issued the following statement on the disbursement of $3.9 billion in direct budget support for Ukraine:
Our economic assistance to Ukraine, including the $3.9 billion tranche disbursed last week, which was appropriated in the bipartisan National Security Supplemental, stabilizes Ukraine’s home front as it continues to defend itself against Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war. With the entirety of Ukraine’s tax revenue going to the war effort, support from the United States and our allies and partners is crucial to equip first responders, keep hospitals and schools open, and maintain other essential government functions.
Our direct budget support to Ukraine continues to be conditioned on reforms that will further increase Ukraine’s economic resilience and improve governance, and I am pleased with the continued unprecedented level of transparency and accountability tied to this support.
Following Russia’s invasion, President Biden marshalled a historic multilateral response, and our partners have stepped up to provide nearly three-fourths of the budget support given to Ukraine.  The Treasury Department will continue to use all our tools to help Ukraine in its brave fight, including sustaining our historic sanctions and working to unlock the value of Russia’s immobilized sovereign assets.  A successful Ukraine will demonstrate the resolve of the United States and our partners to defend democracy against authoritarian aggression, protect the global economy, and reinforce our collective national security.

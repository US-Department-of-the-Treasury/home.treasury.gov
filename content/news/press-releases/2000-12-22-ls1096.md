LS-1096



Yesterday, the United States joined other members of the IMF in supporting Turkey's strengthened economic reforms as the basis for the provision of additional resources under Turkey's IMF program.



The United States supports the enhanced IMF program in recognition of the progress Turkey has made and in light of the vital steps Turkey has committed to for the restoration of confidence and financial stability. As we stated before, we look forward to the strong and immediate implementation of these steps. Turkey's financial stability is important to the United States.

The Treasury Department Tuesday designated five entities for their ties to Iran's nuclear and missile programs. These designations prohibit all transactions between the designees and any U.S. person, and freeze any assets the designees may have under U.S. jurisdiction. These five nuclear and missile entities have been used by Iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions, said Under Sec for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey.

WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Treasury Scott K.H. Bessent is pleased to be collaborating with the ABA Foundation in support of its annual [Teach Children to Save Program](https://www.aba.com/advocacy/community-programs/teach-children-save). As part of Teach Children to Save Day on April 24, the Treasury Department released a [new video message](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1915357572699148667?_sm_nck=1) from the Secretary that will be played during Teach Children to Save presentations to K-8 students across the country.

 

“Whether it’s saving for a rainy day early or educating yourself on the many tools available for you to start investing and building wealth – it’s extremely important for your future,” Secretary Bessent said in the video presentation. “And that’s why programs like Teach Children to Save are so important—they help set you on the path to financial independence."

The annual Teach Children to Save campaign is a centerpiece of the banking industry’s longstanding commitment to youth financial education. Participating banker volunteers will deliver financial lessons to students through a combination of community events, virtual presentations, social media engagement and in-branch resources.

“We deeply appreciate Secretary Bessent's strong support of this year's Teach Children to Save program,” said ABA President and CEO Rob Nichols. “By adding his voice to the banker-led presentations this year, students and teachers will recognize the Treasury Department's commitment to financial education. Secretary Bessent's engagement will make this year's Teach Children to Save presentations even more memorable and effective."

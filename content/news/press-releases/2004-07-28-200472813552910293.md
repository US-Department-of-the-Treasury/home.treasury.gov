Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Wayne Abernathy today speaks at a panel on ID theft and internet fraud hosted by the American Bankers Association. ID theft strikes at the heart of our financial services, at the confidence that lies at their core, said Abernathy. The identity thieves not only rob money, they steal confidence. That is why President Bush has declared this fight to be so important and why we must win it.

FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

Report-3065
The President has proposed a bold and fair tax relief plan that will reduce the inequities of the current tax code and help ensure that America remains prosperous. This tax relief plan promotes the values that make the American economy second to none -- access to the middle class, family, equal opportunity, and the entrepreneurial spirit. This plan will reduce taxes for everyone who pays income taxes, and it will encourage enterprise by lowering marginal tax rates.

Under the Presidents tax relief plan, the typical American family of four will be able to keep atleast $1,600 more of their own money.

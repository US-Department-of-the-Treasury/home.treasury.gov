WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) identified eight Chinese technology firms pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13959, as amended by E.O. 14032. These eight entities actively support the biometric surveillance and tracking of ethnic and religious minorities in China, particularly the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority in Xinjiang. As a result of today’s action, U.S. persons will be prohibited from purchasing or selling certain publicly traded securities connected with these entities, as described in E.O. 13959, as amended.

“Today’s action highlights how private firms in China’s defense and surveillance technology sectors are actively cooperating with the government’s efforts to repress members of ethnic and religious minority groups,” said Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson. “Treasury remains committed to ensuring that the U.S. financial system and American investors are not supporting these activities.”

The entities identified today are **Cloudwalk Technology Co., Ltd.**;**Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd.**;** Leon Technology Company Limited **;** Megvii Technology Limited **;** Netposa Technologies Limited **;** SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd.**;** Xiamen Meiya Pico Information Co., Ltd.**; and** Yitu Limited **.** TECHNOLOGY USED FOR SURVEILLANCE OF RELIGIOUS OR ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS **Beginning in 2016, Chen Quanguo, the then-newly appointed Communist Party Secretary of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, stepped up security and surveillance measures aimed at the Uyghur population in Xinjiang. Such actions included the installation of thousands of neighborhood police kiosks and ubiquitous placement of surveillance cameras, collection of biometric data for identification purposes, and more intrusive monitoring of internet use. By some estimates, since 2017, Xinjiang authorities have arbitrarily detained between 1 million and 1.8 million Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups, including ethnic Kazakhs and others, in “reeducation” centers. On July 9, 2020, Chen Quanguo was[designated](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm1055)pursuant to E.O. 13818, which builds upon and implements the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, for being a foreign person who is or has been a leader or official of an entity, including any government entity, that has engaged in, or whose members have engaged in serious human rights abuse relating to the leader’s or official’s tenure. The surveillance and tracking of ethnic and religious minorities in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) continue to this day.** ACTORS INVOLVED IN THE SURVEILLANCE AND TRACKING OF RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC MINORITIES IN THE PRC Cloudwalk Technology Co., Ltd.**

Cloudwalk Technology Co., Ltd. (Cloudwalk) operates or has operated in the surveillance technology sector of the economy of the PRC. Cloudwalk has developed facial recognition software designed to track and surveil members of ethnic minority groups, including Tibetans and Uyghurs, and alert authorities if too many individuals gather in specific locations. Cloudwalk’s surveillance technology is also used outside of China. In 2018, Cloudwalk and the Zimbabwean government agreed to the installment of a mass surveillance network in Zimbabwe. The agreement included a requirement that the Zimbabwean government send images it acquires from the surveillance network back to Cloudwalk’s offices in China, so that Cloudwalk could improve the ability of its facial recognition software to recognize individuals based on skin pigmentation.

**Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd **Dawning Information Industry Co., Ltd (Dawning) operates or has operated in the defense and related materiel sector of the economy of the PRC and owns or controls, directly or indirectly, Xinjiang Sugon Cloud Computing Co., Ltd.

Today, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent convened a meeting with the so-called "Big 6" group at the U.S. Department of Treasury with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Majority Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith. James Blair, Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for the Office of Legislative Affairs and James Braid, Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs, were also in attendance.

The group discussed the importance of permanently extending the Trump Tax Cuts to prevent the largest tax hike in history on American workers, families and small businesses.

“The American people gave this Administration a clear mandate to restore our nation’s prosperity—lower taxes, bigger paychecks, and a stronger economy,” said Secretary Bessent. “I am dedicated to working with Congress in making permanent President Trump’s historic tax cuts and reviving the American dream. Today’s productive meeting gives me confidence that a swift timeframe is achievable. “

**Washington , DC --** The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated seven individuals with ties to the Iraqi insurgency and the former Iraqi regime.One individual was designated for providing financial and material support to Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and the six other individuals were designated as senior officials of the former Iraqi regime or their immediate family members, some of whom provided financial and material support to Iraq insurgents.

The United States is acting today against former regime elements and others supporting the Iraqi insurgency out of Syria, said Stuart Levey, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.Syria must take action to deny safe haven to those supporting violence from within its borders.

Fawzi Mutlaq Al-Rawi was designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224, which is aimed at terrorists and those providing them with financial and other support.The other six individuals were designated pursuant to Executive Order 13315, which targets senior officials of the former Iraqi regime or their immediate family members.

Designations under E.O. 13224 and E.O. 13315 are implemented by Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, and prohibit all transactions between the designees and any U.S. person and freeze any assets the designees may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Fawzi Mutlaq Al-Rawi, the leader of the Iraqi wing of the Syrian Ba'th Party, was designated under E.O. 13224 for providing financial and material support to AQI.

Al-Rawi in November 2005 facilitated the provision of $300,000 to members of AQI.In addition, he provided AQI with vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, rifles, and suicide bombersat the request of a senior AQI leader in Iraq.Al-Rawi and that same leader in September 2005attended a meeting in Ar Ramadi, Iraq, with other senior AQI representatives where they discussed financing, unifying AQI forces, conducting airborne improvised explosive device attacks against the U.S. Embassy, and concentrating attacks against the international zone.

As of March 2005, Al-Rawi was present at regular meetings to plan funding for Muhammad Yunis Ahmad's network in Iraq.Ahmad, who was designated pursuant to E.O. 13315 in June 2005 and named on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 list, has provided guidance, financial support, and coordination for insurgent attacks throughout Iraq.Al-Rawi also ran a charity organization which was actually a front for funding the network.As of December 2006, Al-Rawi continued to support AQI, meeting regularly with a senior member of the organization to discuss funding and to plan future operations in Iraq.

Al-Rawi was appointed leader of the Iraqi wing of the Syrian Ba'th Party by Syrian President Bashar Al-Asad in 2003. The Iraqi wing of the Syrian Ba'th Party has since provided significant funding to Iraqi insurgents at Al-Rawi's direction.Al-Rawi is supported financially by the Syrian Government, and has close ties to Syrian Intelligence.He has met with Syrian Intelligence Director Asif Shawkat, and has received financial support directly from Dhu al-Himma al-Shalish, former Chief of Asad's Presidential Security Guard.Shawkat was named a Specially Designated National pursuant to E.O. 13338 on January 18, 2006 for directly furthering the Government of Syria's support for terrorism and interference in the sovereignty of Lebanon.Shalish was named a Specially Designated National pursuant to E.O. 13315 in June 2005 for acting on behalf of Saddam Hussein's former regime.

Under the authorization of the Syrian government, Al-Rawi in 2004 met twice with a former commander of Saddam Hussein's Army of Muhammad – a militant group formed by Saddam Hussein to fight against Coalition forces in Iraq.Al-Rawi reportedly informed the commander that the Army of Muhammad would receive material aid from Syria in the form of goods given to the Army for resale in Iraq rather than money, due to international concerns that Syria was supporting terrorism and the resistance in Iraq.

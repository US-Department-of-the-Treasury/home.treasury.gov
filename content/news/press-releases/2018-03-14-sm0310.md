**Washington**– Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin joined President Trump on his visit to Boeing Co.'s plant in St. Louis, Missouri. They met with Boeing employees and leadership, as well as representatives from companies across Missouri to discuss the benefits and positive impact of the*Tax Cuts & Jobs Act*on Missouri companies and employees.

"American businesses and workers are winning again because of President Trump's economic policies," said Secretary Mnuchin. "Hundreds of companies across our country, fourteen of which are based in Missouri, have announced bonuses, wage increases, enhanced benefits, and new hiring because of the*Tax Cuts & Jobs Act*. These changes are already benefiting over 4.5 million employees. Boeing has announced the investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in facilities, employee training and workforce development, which are the types of investments that will lead to sustained economic growth. The President is following through on his promise to provide relief to hardworking families, make our businesses more competitive, and grow our economy."

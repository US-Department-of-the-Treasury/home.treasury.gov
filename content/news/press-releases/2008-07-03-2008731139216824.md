The Treasury Department recently completed mass disbursements of stimulus payments. In total, 112.4 million stimulus payments have been sent to American households, so far injecting $91 billion into the U.S. economy. Payments will continue to be sent out in small batches through the remainder of the year. To ensure that all Americans who qualify for a stimulus payment receive one, the Internal Revenue Service recently announced that it will be reaching out to over 5 million seniors and veterans who have not yet filed a simple tax return to get their payment.

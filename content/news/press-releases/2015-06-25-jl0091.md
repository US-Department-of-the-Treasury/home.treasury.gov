​  Today’s Supreme Court decision upholds the availability of tax credits under the Affordable Care Act in every state and ensures that millions of Americans will retain their access to affordable health care.  The Affordable Care Act is working.  Since the law was passed, more than 16 million uninsured people have gained health coverage, and evidence shows that families and businesses are benefiting from improved affordability, access, and quality of care.  I hope that today’s decision marks the end of the partisan fight about the law and that we can move forward in a bipartisan manner to make the health care system better for the benefit of all Americans.

The Treasury Department announced Tuesday that Secretary Lawrence H. Summers will lead the U.S. delegation at the China-United States Joint Economic Committee meeting on Oct. 25 in Beijing, China.

This 12thJEC meeting will focus on the economic policy and financial issues facing China and the United States in the months ahead as well as enforcement issues and international trade. The last meeting was held May 1998 in Washington, D.C.

Our capacity to forge a constructive path with China and to support its closer integration into the world economy will be fundamental to how we deal with the strategic and economic challenges of this new era, Secretary Summers said.

“I have known Danny Werfel for more than 15 years. He is an immensely talented and dedicated public servant who has ably served presidents of both parties. Danny has a strong record of raising his hand for -- and excelling at -- tough management assignments.  He is also a familiar face on Capitol Hill, where he has testified many times and always demonstrates both his characteristic humility and his complete mastery of the subject matter.  I am grateful to him for accepting this new challenge, and I am confident that his self-evident integrity and outstanding management skills will make an immediate difference in helping to restore public confidence in the IRS.”

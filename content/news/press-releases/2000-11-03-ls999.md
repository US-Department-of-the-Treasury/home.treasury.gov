LS-999

We share the concern expressed by the European Central Bank (ECB) in the context of its action today in the exchange markets about the implications of the broad movements in the euro for the world economy. We reaffirm our commitment to the G-7 statement of September 23, 2000 and to our longstanding strong dollar policy.

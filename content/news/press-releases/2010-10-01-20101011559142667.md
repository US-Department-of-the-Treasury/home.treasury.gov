On Friday afternoon, Secretary Geithner, in his capacity as chairperson of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, hosted the Council's first meeting at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Council will provide, for the first time, comprehensive oversight over the stability of our nation's financial system. It is charged with identifying threats to the financial stability of the United States; promoting market discipline by eliminating expectations on the part of shareholders, creditors, and counterparties of such companies that the government will shield them from losses in the event of failure; and responding to emerging risks to the stability of the United States financial system.

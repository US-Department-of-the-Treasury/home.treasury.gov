Secretary Snow today gave introductory remarks at an economic roundtable on Social Security co-hosted by the Treasury Department and the Council of Economic Advisors. Because of our changing demographics, the structure of the program simply isn't going to work for future generations the way it did for retirees of the 20th century. It is time to modernize the program, and the sooner we do so, the better. The future of our children and grandchildren, and future of our great economy, absolutely depend on it.

WASHINGTON – From November 26 – December 1, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson will travel to Muscat, Oman as well as Ankara and Istanbul, Türkiye, to further U.S. efforts to deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and move funds. He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.

In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine.

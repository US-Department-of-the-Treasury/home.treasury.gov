In support of a State Department amendment to the designation of Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), the Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has listed the National Council of Resistance in Iran (NCRI) -- previously listed as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) -- as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224 and has clarified that the National Council of Resistance (NCR) and Peoples Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI) are aliases of MEK.  The listing also clarifies that the designation includes the U.S. representative offices of NCRI and the U.S. press office of PMOI.  These organizations have been added to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, effectively freezing all assets and properties and prohibiting transactions between U.S. persons and these organizations.

On September 16, 2002, the United States and Spain co-chaired a meeting of the FATF Terrorist Financing Working Group in Madrid to discuss international standards and measures being taken in the war against terrorist financing.  The Working Group achieved substantial progress in implementing its mandate to elaborate upon the Eight Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing initially adopted by the FATF in October 2001.  The United States is pleased with the continued close collaboration of our Spanish counterparts and the cooperation of over 20 countries and international organizations participating in today's meeting to address the continued threat of terrorism.

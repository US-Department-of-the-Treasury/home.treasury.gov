Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill is in North and South Carolina Monday and Tuesday this week discussing President Bush's efforts to strengthen the economic recovery. O'Neill has spent a considerable amount of time traveling the country to meet with people on the front lines of the American economy -small business owners, employees, individual investors, business leaders, economists and farmers--to discuss where our economy stands, the impact of the policies we have put in place, and the steps we are taking as we move forward.  Among other events, O'Neill will be speaking at the Greenville and Spartanburg Chambers of Commerce and the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce.

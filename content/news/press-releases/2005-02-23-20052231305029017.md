Secretary John W. Snow will travel to Tampa and Jacksonville, FL on February 24-25 to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve the Social Security system. Social Security is sound for today's seniors and those nearing retirement, but to keep the promise of Social Security alive for our children and grandchildren, we need to fix the system now, once and for all.

We at Treasury are very pleased that Ronald K. Noble, former Under Secretary for Enforcement, has been selected by the INTERPOL Executive Committee to be the next Secretary General of INTERPOL, the first American to hold the position.



As Secretary General, Ron will make use of his vast expertise on law enforcement issues and demonstrate the unwavering commitment to justice that has marked his entire career.



The selection of Ron Noble and the leadership shown by INTERPOL Executive Committee member and Customs Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly demonstrate the continued U.S. commitment to the international law enforcement arena.



Noble's selection will be ratified by the 177-member nations at the INTERPOL General Assembly in Seoul, Korea this fall.

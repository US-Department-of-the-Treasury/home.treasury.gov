JS-2002

The steady increase in jobs, which we've seen now for thirteen consecutive months, continued in September. Since August of last year, America has added more than 1.9 million workers to the payroll, including the addition of 96,000 last month and the upward revisions announced today by the Labor Department showing that job growth has been stronger than previously reported. The unemployment rate of 5.4 percent remains under the average of each of the past three decades.

Today's employment report shows the steady creation of jobs fueled by the pro-growth policies and strong economic leadership of President Bush. While we're encouraged with today's report, we're not satisfied. The President has made clear his continuing commitment to keep this economy on an upward path of economic growth and job creation.

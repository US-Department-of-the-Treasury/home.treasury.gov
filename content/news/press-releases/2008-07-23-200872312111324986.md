Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. urges the Senate to pass legislation that will strengthen the government-sponsored enterprises. I look forward to working with the Senate to get legislation to the President's desk this week, said Paulson. He commended the House Wednesday on quick action to pass a housing bill. I'm pleased the House acted quickly to pass an important GSE bill that will provide temporary authorities to give confidence to markets and will create a strong, independent regulator better able to address the risks these enterprises pose.

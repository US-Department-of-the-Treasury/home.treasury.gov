The Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan is part of the President's broad, comprehensive strategy to get the economy back on track.  The plan will **help up to 7 to 9 million families restructure or refinance their mortgages to avoid foreclosure.**In doing so, the plan not only helps responsible homeowners on the verge of defaulting, but prevents neighborhoods and communities from being pulled over the edge too, as defaults and foreclosures contribute to falling home values, failing local businesses, and lost jobs.

President Uribe told me today of his resolve to pursue an ambitious economic agenda to complement his plan to confront narco-trafficking, fight terrorism, and extend the rule of law throughout Colombia.   We commend this resolve and endorse his commitment to productivity growth and financial stability.   We actively support current discussions between Colombia and the international financial institutions to mobilize financing to advance reform and to meet the needs of the challenging period ahead.   The policy actions that President Uribe has committed to take deserve the strong and timely support of the international community.   We look forward to rapid agreement on new programs.

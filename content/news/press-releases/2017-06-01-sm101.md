​ **Washington**— Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today in response to President Donald J. Trump’s decision on the Paris Accord:   “The Paris Accord places American workers and businesses at a significant disadvantage, and imposes disproportionate burdens on the U.S. economy compared to other nations.  Our country has already reduced carbon emissions significantly through innovation which supports both a strong economy and a clean environment. Meanwhile, others get a free pass to increase emissions through deals like the Paris Accord which does not support these goals.”     ####

Statement by Treasury Department Spokesman Rob Nichols:



On Thursday and Friday, April 3-4, Treasury Secretary John Snow will embark to Florida to discuss President George W. Bush’s Jobs and Growth plan.  The Secretary will travel to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, and Naples to meet with members of the hospitality and tourist industry, local economic officials, small business owners, individual investors, business leaders, and members of the financial services industry to highlight the importance of swiftly enacting the President’s Jobs and Growth plan, which will create and secure jobs, accelerate and sustain our economic recovery, and increase workers' standards of living.  More than 5 million taxpayers in Florida will have lower income tax bills in 2003 under the President’s growth package.



During meetings with senior citizens, the Secretary will pay special attention to discussing the elimination of the double taxation of dividends – a key component of President Bush’s Jobs and Growth plan.  One point seven million taxpayers in Florida will benefit from the exclusion of dividends paid from previously-taxed corporate income.

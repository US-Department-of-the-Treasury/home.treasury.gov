Treasury Secretary John W. Snow issued the following statement today on Senate confirmation of Treasury nominees:

- Robert Kimmitt, Deputy Secretary
- Tim Adams, Under Secretary for International Affairs
- Randal Quarles, Under Secretary for Domestic Finance
- Janice Gardner, Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis
- Kevin Fromer, Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs
- Sandra Pack, Assistant Secretary for Management
- John Dugan, Comptroller of the Currency
- John Reich, Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision

I'm grateful the Senate acted today to put in place at Treasury a team of superb individuals to carry out the critical issues before the Department. Priorities ranging from preserving and strengthening Social Security for future generations, to reforming the tax code, to disrupting the financial underpinnings of terrorist networks and other national security threats, are critical to keeping our country on the current upward path of economic growth and job creation. I look forward to working with them to ensure economic security and prosperity for the American people, and I commend the tremendous staff at the Treasury Department for their hard work over the past months.

JS-956

Chairman Thomas, Ranking Member Rangel, Members of the Committee, thank you for giving me the opportunity to testify on economic relations between the United States and China and on Chinas role in the global economy.

**International Economic Strategy** Our economic relations with China are an important part of our overall economic strategy. The goal of that strategy is to strengthen the current economic recovery and establish conditions that will lead to a long economic expansion in the United States.  The economic expansions of the 1980s and the 1990s were the first and second longest peacetime expansions in American history, and with the right policies there is no reason to expect that the current expansion will not be as long or longer.  The Jobs and Growth package enacted into law this summer, is an essential part of the policy, as are the Presidents proposals for tort reform, regulatory reform, and health care reform.

But even with these policy reforms in the United States there are barriers to economic growth in other countries.  And these barriers have ramifications for economic growth in the United States. This is why the international component of our economic strategy is so important.

The strategy has been to urge the removal of rigidities and barriers wherever they exist, and to encourage pro-growth and pro-stability policies that benefit the United States and the whole world. The international strategy is built on bilateral economic relationships, including, of course, our relationship with China.  It also has a multilateral foundation, including the meetings of groups such as the G-20, where China is included, or the newly established talks between economic officials from China and the G-7. **Global Economic Recovery** Thanks to the recent fiscal and monetary policy actions, the United States economy is now expanding much more rapidly.  Consumer spending is growing at a very strong pace, housing remains solid, and business investment is picking up. The latest data also show exports to be gaining strength compared with the first half of the year. The September employment data showed a promising increase in jobs as well.Global growth is also improving. There is continuing evidence of stronger economic growth in the Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom. An increase in business and consumer confidence in the Euro area is a welcome sign that economic recovery is on the way there too.  Much of Asia seems to have bounded back from the SARS induced slowdown in the first part of the year. Growth in China recovered sharply in the third quarter following a decline in the second quarter.  Growth in other emerging markets is also picking up as the number of crises is down, capital flows are up, and interest rate spreads are low compared with the late 1990s **Pressing Ahead on the Global Economic Expansion** Despite this progress, we need to do more.  Last month the G7 launched a new Agenda for Growth. For the first time each G7 country will take part in a process of benchmarking and reporting actions to spur growth and create jobs.  Another example is the new United States-Brazil Group for Growth through which we will work together to identify pro-growth strategies at the micro as well as macro levels. Exchange rate policy also has bearing on growth and stability. Earlier today the Treasury issued its latest Report on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies.  This report examines exchange rate policies in major countries around the world.  The Report reiterated our view that flexible exchange rates are desirable for large economies.  However, the report documents that a number of countries continued to use pegged exchange rates and/or to intervene substantially in the foreign exchange market.  The Administration strongly believes that a system of flexible, market-based exchange rates is best for major economies.  For this reason, the Bush Administration is aggressively encouraging our major trading partners to adopt policies that promote flexible market-based exchange rates combined with a clear price stability goal and a transparent system for adjusting the policy instruments.The move by several large emerging market countriessuch as Brazil, Korea, and Mexicoto flexible exchange rates combined with clear price stability goals and a transparent system for adjusting the policy instruments is one of the reasons we are seeing fewer crises and greater stability. We emphasize that the choice of an exchange rate regime is one where country ownership is particularly important. We also recognize that, especially in the case of small open economies, there are benefits from a hardexchange rate peg, whether dollarizing, as with El Salvador, joining a currency union, as with Greece, or using a credible currency board, as in Bulgaria. **The Economy of China and its Links to the United States and the Global Economy** Let me now address Chinas economy.  Economic reforms in China have increased economic growth and transformed China into a major economy in the world, both in terms of total production and in terms of purchases and sales of goods with the rest of the world. Yet, with per capita income of only about $1,000 per year and with financial, legal and regulatory systems in need of reform, China still faces challenges in its effort to catch up with developed economies.

Chinas global current account surplus was under 3 percent of GDP in 2002 and declined to 1.8 percent in the first half of 2003.  Despite the relatively small overall surplus, China has a large trade surplus with the United States. This means, of course, that China has a large deficit with the rest of the world. Chinas bilateral trade surplus with the United States was $103 billion in 2002 while Chinas trade deficit with the rest of the world was about $73 billion, leaving an overall surplus of $30 billion.   Many imports from China are goods from other Asian economies that are processed or finished off in China before shipping to the United States and other countries. Other East Asian economies increasingly send goods to China for final processing before they are shipped to the United States. China accounted for 11 percent of U.S. imports in 2002, up from 3 percent in 1990. Meanwhile, the combined share of Japan, Korea and Taiwan in U.S. imports declined to 17 percent from 27 percent over the same period. Thus, the total share of U.S. imports coming from these four Asian countries has remained steady since 1990, actually falling slightly from 30 percent to 29 percent.

U.S. imports from China are about 1 percent of U.S. GDP, or 11 percent of total U.S. imports. U.S. imports from China have been increasing rapidly, between 20 and 25 percent in 2002 and 2003. In general, these imports result from China using low-skilled labor to assemble and process imported parts and materials originating in other countries-mostly from other Asian countries that have traditionally exported directly to the United States. Consequently, the share of U.S. imports from these other countries has declined just as Chinas share has increased. Asias share of U.S. imports has declined slightly. Much of the increase in U.S. imports from China has come at the expense of imports that once came directly from other Asian countries.

At the same time, U.S. merchandise exports to China grew 21 percent in the first 8 months of this year.  Growth has been especially rapid in recent years for U.S. exports to China of transportation equipment (including aircraft engines), machinery, chemicals, and semiconductors.

The U.S. trade deficit with China should be viewed in the context of the overall trade deficit of the United States.  The U.S. trade deficit is spread across many countries of the world in addition to China. For instance, the overall trade deficit reached $468 billion last year with 1) the Americas accounting for $105 billion, 2) Western Europe $89 billion, 3) Japan $70 billion, and 4) China $103 billion. The U.S. overall trade and current account deficit is best understood in terms of the gap between investment and saving in the United States. If this gap were reduced through an increment in savings, the overall deficit could shrink as would the size of the bilateral deficits.  Increased growth abroad is also crucial to increasing U.S. exports.

**Chinas Exchange Rate Regime** For nearly ten years now, the Chinese have maintained a fixed exchange rate for their currency relative to the dollar. The rate has been pegged at about 8.28 yuan/dollar for the entire period. Thus, as the dollar has appreciated or depreciated in value relative to other currencies, such as the euro or the yen, the yuan has appreciated or depreciated by the same amount relative to these other countries.

To maintain this fixed exchange rate, the central bank of China has had to intervene in the foreign exchange market. It sells yuan in exchange for dollar denominated assets when the demand for the yuan increases and it buys yuan with dollar denominated assets when the demand for the yuan decreases. Recently the central bank has intervened very heavily in the markets to prevent the yuan from appreciating. Since the end of 2001, dollar buying has been so great that the foreign reserves held by the Chinese government have risen by $171 billion to $384 billion (as of end-September).

This accumulation of foreign exchange reserves would tend to expand Chinas money supply, although in recent months the Chinese central bank has moved to reign in monetary expansion. Among other measures to sterilize reserve accumulation, the central bank hasfor the first timebegun issuing central bank paper to restrict growth of the monetary base. Nevertheless, the broader money supply continues to grow very rapidly: M2 climbed 21 percent over the 12 months ending in September 2003.It is also important to recognize that China still has significant capital controls. Chinas capital controls allow for more inflows than outflows, thus bolstering foreign exchange reserves. China is gradually loosening some controls, and outflows are likely to grow as new channels develop for Chinese to seek diversification and better returns than those offered by low domestic interest rates. Indeed, there is already significant leakage of capital. A relaxation of controls on outflows would reduce upward pressure on the yuan.

**Economic Relations between the United States and China** With its rapid growth and substantial foreign exchange reserves, China is now in a position to show leadership on the important global issue of exchange rate flexibility. China represents one of the largest economies in the world, and a flexible exchange rate regime would be a good policy for China. It would allow China to open the nation to capital flows and reduce macroeconomic imbalances. We have been urging China to move to a flexible exchange rate.

We have also urged the Chinese to move forward in two other areas: reductions in barriers to trade and capital flows. In the area of trade, it is important for China to fully implement, and even surpass, the commitments it made to the World Trade Organization. It is important that China continue to open markets to U.S. services, agricultural and industrial products, and to effectively enforce intellectual property laws.

Chinas restrictions on capital flows are one of the major rigidities interfering with market forces. The authorities understand this and are beginning to reduce barriers to capital flows and develop more open and sophisticated capital markets. They are also working to strengthen the banking system and liberalize capital flows in order to prepare for a more flexible exchange rate.Secretary Snow traveled to Beijing last month to urge further progress.  He met Premier Wen, Vice Premier Huang, Central Bank Governor Zhou, and Finance Minister Jin. He met again with the Finance Minister and Central Bank Governor last week in Mexico.

President Bush recently met with President Hu.  He discussed each of these economic issues.  He stressed the importance of reducing barriers to trade, of removing restrictions on the transfer of capital, and of moving to a flexible, market-based, exchange rate.  Recently, both Secretary Evans and US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick traveled to China to stress the importance market opening, especially in the area of trade in goods and services.  In an important recent development, Vice Premier Huang has accepted an invitation to come to the United States to engage in high-level talks with Secretary Snow.

All of Secretary Snows meetings have been detailed and candid.  He stated publicly, the establishment of flexible exchange rates, of a flexible exchange rate regime, would benefit both our nations as well as our regional and global trading partners.The Chinese reported that they intend to move to a market-based flexible exchange rate as they open the capital account. The central bank governor stated publicly that reform of the exchange rate regime is a central part of their foreign exchange reforms.

Secretary Snows visit to Beijing achieved significant progress, including new policy announcements by Chinas central bank; liberalized regulations for foreign firms managing their foreign exchange; and significantly liberalized provisions to allow Chinese travelers to take foreign currency out of the country and to do so more frequently. The United States will continue to urge the Chinese to make rapid progress in these areas.

We intend to continue both technical work and high-level talks and on this subject. We have just established a United States-China Technical Cooperation Program in the financial area that will help China develop its financial market infrastructure, including the foreign exchange market.The Chinese and the G7 agreed to engage in talks about these economic issues. This represents another example of how China, the United States and other affected parties can come together to work on an issue of vital interest to them all. The first meeting between senior officials from the G-7 and Chinas finance ministry and central bank took place in September in Dubai, where the Chinese economy, the G7 economies, and other economic issues, were discussed. Further meetings will be scheduled on a regular basis with China, the United States and the other G7 countries. After the Dubai meeting, Chinas central bank representative said that China is moving as fast as it can in its reform.

**Conclusion** I am pleased to report that our economic strategy is showing progress: global economic growth is accelerating, led by an even stronger acceleration of economic growth in the United States.  Our efforts to engage in financial diplomacy are generating constructive responses, though much more needs to be done.  Active engagement with China and other countries is paving the way toward freer markets. The Administrations effort to raise growth in the United States and abroad, and thereby create jobs at home is succeeding.

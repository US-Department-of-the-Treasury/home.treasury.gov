In 2007 millions of Americans will see their tax bills reduced by billions of dollars thanks to President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax relief. With more money in American's pockets they are able to save or make investments, both of which help our economy grow and become stronger. Now, with that tax relief set to expire in 2010, it's important that relief is made permanent so millions of Americans don't face significant tax increases in the future.

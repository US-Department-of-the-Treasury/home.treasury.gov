November's job creation numbers are a confirmation that the American economy is on a steady growth path. The economy has created more than 2 million jobs so far this year, averaging nearly 200,000 new jobs a month. This is the fifteenth consecutive month of job creation, with the economy adding 112,000 new jobs in November. This is a clear sign that the President's economic policies are working the way they were intended.

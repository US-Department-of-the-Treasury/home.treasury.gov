Deputy Secretary Dam will travel to Malaysia, China and South Korea May 4-14, 2002.



During his trip Dam will discuss financial sector reform, growth and openness. In high-level discussions with a wide array of senior government officials and private sector political, financial and economic experts, Dam will raise the importance of greater openness to trade in financial services and will promote its impact on economic growth and stability in those markets that embrace it.



Dam will also represent the United States at the Asian Development Bank meeting in China.



This is Dam's second trip to Asia in six months. In December 2001, Dam traveled to Japan to discuss a range of steps supportive of strong economic growth and collaborative efforts to stop terrorist financing.



Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Richard Clarida will join other treasury officials in accompanying Dam.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement on the Senate’s passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act:
“The Senate took an important step today toward achieving common sense financial regulation. This bipartisan legislation will safeguard American consumers through proper and effective oversight. The bill will also streamline and tailor regulation to ensure that our community banks are able to spend resources to lend, businesses are able to grow, and consumers have access to credit. We look forward to working with policymakers as the House considers this legislation.”

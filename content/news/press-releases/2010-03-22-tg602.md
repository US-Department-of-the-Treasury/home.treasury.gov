**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the following statement from Secretary Tim Geithner on the Senate Banking Committee's passage of the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010:

This is a good day for the cause of financial reform. I would like to commend Chairman Dodd for his leadership over the past year and his Committee, which today voted a strong reform bill to the floor. We look forward to working with the full Senate to pass a bill that provides strong protection for consumers, strong constraints on risk taking by large institutions, and strong tools to protect the economy and taxpayers from future crises.

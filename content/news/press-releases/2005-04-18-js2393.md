James Gilleran has been a dedicated leader at the Office of Thrift Supervision for over three years as well as an outstanding Chairman for the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council for the past two years. His efforts in both capacities have gone a long way toward strengthening the U.S. banking system.  He has worked diligently to maintain safety and soundness at the nation's banking institutions and to ensure the industry's ability to meet the financial needs of Americans.  A dedicated public servant, Director Gilleran has made innumerable contributions to the Treasury Department during his tenure here.  His colleagues and I wish him well in his future endeavors. He departs with the sincere appreciation and best wishes of all of us here at Treasury.

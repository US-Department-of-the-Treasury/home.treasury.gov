Deputy Secretary Robert M. Kimmitt spoke this week before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City on the importance of open economies, the rise of investment protectionism and the growth of sovereign wealth funds. By resisting trends toward protectionism, we can help ensure a level playing field for all investors and greater prosperity for workers around the world, said Kimmitt.

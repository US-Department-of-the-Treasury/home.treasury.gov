United States Treasury Secretary John Snow was in Henderson County, N.C. on Friday visiting a local community college and a company that is an industry leader in fuel cell technology, an alternative energy source. As Treasury Secretary, I'm dedicated to sustaining the strength of the U.S. economy for future generations. Worker training and innovative energy solutions are two critical components of that ongoing effort, Snow said.

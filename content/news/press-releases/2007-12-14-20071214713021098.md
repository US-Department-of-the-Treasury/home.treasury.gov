Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. will travel to Orlando, Kansas City, Stockton, Calif. and Los Angeles this week to discuss the Administration's efforts to address mortgage market issues and help families struggling with their mortgage avoid foreclosure. Recently Paulson joined President Bush and HUD Secretary Jackson to commend a private sector effort to streamline the refinancing and modification process and deliver quicker help to homeowners facing foreclosure.

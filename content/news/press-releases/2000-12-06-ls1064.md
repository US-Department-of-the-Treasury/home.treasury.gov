FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-1064

We welcome the announcement by the Turkish authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of a strengthened reform program.

We look forward to strong and immediate implementation by the Turkish authorities of the steps vital for the restoration of confidence and financial stability.

Turkey's financial stability is important to the United States.

  ** Washington − The U.S. Treasury Department today issued the following statement:**The U.S. Treasury Department today issued the following statement: 

The Financial Action Task Force's statement on Iran today sends a clear message to governments and financial institutions worldwide that the threat Iran poses to the international financial system continues unabated. Not only has FATF reiterated its October statement expressing concern about Iran's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing deficiencies, the FATF has called upon its members to advise their financial institutions of this risk and urged all other countries to do the same.



Treasury commends FATF, as the premier standard-setting body for countering terrorist financing and money laundering, for its responsible action in response to Iran's failure to institute an anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime that meets international standards.

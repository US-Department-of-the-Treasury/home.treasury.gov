Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. today issued the following statement on International Monetary Fund Managing Director De Rato's announcement that the Fund revised its framework for exercising surveillance over members' exchange rate policies:

The revised decision also demonstrates that the IMF is serious about reforming itself and enhancing its legitimacy and relevance in today's global economic and financial system.**-30-**

The Labor Department announced last week that 92,000 jobs were created in July. Our economy has now added jobs for 47 straight months and the unemployment rate remains low at 4.6%. The U.S. economy and the job market are healthy, with sustained job growth, low unemployment, and rising wages. Solid fundamentals will support continued growth in household spending and business investment, said Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Phillip Swagel.

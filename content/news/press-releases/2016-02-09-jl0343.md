*“We have seen a sustained economic recovery since President Obama took office seven years ago in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Nonetheless, we have much more work to do to ensure that the benefits of our growth are shared by all Americans. Today’s budget and Treasury’s Greenbook strive to address these and other pressing challenges our country faces through a series of tax proposals aimed at reforming the tax code, investing in infrastructure and protecting working families. These proposals would create the conditions for sustained economic growth while upholding the basic American belief that everyone who works hard should get a fair shot at success,” said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew.*

**WASHINGTON** – Under the President’s leadership, we have turned our economy around and created 14 million jobs. Our unemployment rate is below five percent for the first time in almost eight years. Nearly 18 million people have gained health coverage as the Affordable Care Act has taken effect. And we have dramatically cut our deficits by almost three-quarters and set our Nation on a more sustainable fiscal path.

Yet while it is important to take stock of our progress, this Budget is not about looking back at the road we have traveled. It is about looking forward and making sure our economy works for everybody, not just those at the top. It is about choosing investments that not only make us stronger today, but also reflect the kind of country we aspire to be – the kind of country we want to pass on to our children and grandchildren.

The Budget makes critical investments in our domestic and national security priorities while adhering to the bipartisan budget agreement signed into law last fall, and it lifts sequestration in future years so that we continue to invest in our economic future and our national security. It also drives down deficits and maintains our fiscal progress through smart savings from health care, immigration, and tax reforms.

The Budget shows that the President and the Administration remain focused on meeting our greatest challenges – including accelerating the pace of innovation to tackle climate change and find new treatments for devastating diseases; giving everyone a fair shot at opportunity and economic security; and advancing our national security and global leadership – not only for the year ahead, but for decades to come.

Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released a key document that points the way toward meeting these challenges – the General Explanations of the Administration's FY2017 Revenue Proposals, or “[Greenbook](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/General-Explanations-FY2017.pdf),” which explains the Administration’s revenue proposals included in the Budget.

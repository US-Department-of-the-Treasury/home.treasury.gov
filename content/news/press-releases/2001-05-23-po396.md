Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill statement on the Senate passage of the tax bill:

Today's Senate vote confirms strong bipartisan support for the tax relief principles the President has embraced: cutting income tax rates, increasing the child credit, reducing the marriage penalty and eliminating the death tax. I'm glad members in the Senate decided to put politics aside and allow this bipartisan legislation to move forward. It's now clear that working Americans are going to receive significant tax relief. I look forward to working with the conferees to finish this important work quickly, so we can start sending tax dollars back to the people who sent it in as quickly as possible.

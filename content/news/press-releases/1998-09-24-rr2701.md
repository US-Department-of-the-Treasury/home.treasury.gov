The new IRS mission statement reflects the agency's commitment to treat taxpayers fairly and collect our nation's revenue efficiently and effectively.



Since the passing of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, the IRS has taken bold steps to become more customer-focused and customer-oriented by implementing Problem-Solving Days, Citizen Advocacy Panels, expanded electronic filing programs, and the Innocent Spouses Relief Act.



I commend the IRS for their continued efforts to ensure that every American taxpayer comes first and receives fairness and quality customer service.

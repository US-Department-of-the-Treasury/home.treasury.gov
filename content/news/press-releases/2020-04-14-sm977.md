WASHINGTON
– U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement on the Payroll Support Program for passenger air carriers:
“We welcome the news that a number of major airlines intend to participate in the Payroll Support Program. This is an important CARES Act program that will support American workers and help preserve the strategic importance of the airline industry while allowing for appropriate compensation to the taxpayers.
“Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, United Airlines, SkyWest Airlines, and Southwest Airlines have told us that they plan to participate in the Payroll Support Program. Conversations continue with other airlines regarding their potential participation. Treasury is also working to review and approve applications for smaller passenger air carriers as quickly as possible and will provide further guidance for cargo carriers and contractors very soon. We look forward to working with the airlines to finalize the necessary agreements and disburse funds as quickly as possible.”

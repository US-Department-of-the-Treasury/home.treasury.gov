Upon announcement of his retirement, we gratefully acknowledge the many contributions of Stanley E. Morris as Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

Established in 1990, FinCEN provides state-of-the-art, computer tracking and analysis on money laundering and other financial crimes to federal, state and local law enforcement. Its main mission is to aid law enforcement agencies in their money-laundering investigations.

After nearly 30 years of public service, Director Morris leaves behind a legacy of assisting several Administrations in the law enforcement arena. Most notably, he increased the profile of the international campaign to combat money laundering through his work with the Financial Action Task Force. In addition, his regulatory advances made possible the enormous success of the recent Geographic Targeting Orders against Columbia and the Dominican Republic.

The Treasury Department will miss Director Morris' many contributions, and we wish him well in his future endeavors.

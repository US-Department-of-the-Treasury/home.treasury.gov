LS-169



This legislation, if successfully completed, would at the end of the 20thcentury replace archaic financial restrictions with a legal foundation for a 21stcentury financial system. It would benefit consumers by providing them with more choice, lower prices through competition, new privacy protections, and continued investment in their communities. It would benefit the economy by promoting financial innovation, lower capital costs and greater international competitiveness.

FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-1047

I welcome today's statement by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision urging banks and thrifts to look carefully at the risks associated with payday and auto title lending through third parties. These advisories are an important part of the Department's ongoing efforts to ensure that abusive or predatory lending practices do not undermine the important progress we have made in expanding access to capital.

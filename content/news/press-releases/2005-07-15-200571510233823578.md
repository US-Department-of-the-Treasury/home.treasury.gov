The New Markets Tax Credit program spurs development and creates jobs in communities most in need, said Secretary of the Treasury John Snow. By leveraging private sector involvement, we're putting these communities on a path to continued development and prosperity.

Treasury announced today the opening of the fourth round of competition for the allocation of up to $3.5 billion in tax credits under the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program. The NMTC Program attracts private-sector capital investment into the nation's urban and rural low-income areas to help finance community development projects, stimulate economic growth and create jobs.

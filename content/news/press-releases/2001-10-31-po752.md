Following Treasury's Quarterly Refunding press conference this morning, it came to our attention that the content of the announcement was made public prior to the 10:00AM embargo.



The announcement was inadvertently posted on the Treasury web site at approximately 9:50AM. Treasury regrets that this occurred and will work to ensure the integrity of the announcement process.

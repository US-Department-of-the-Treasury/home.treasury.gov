The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) added five Colombian individuals and twenty-two entities to its list of Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNTs) this week for their ties to the North Valle drug cartel. Today's action levies financial sanctions against another group of previously-concealed entities and individuals operating on behalf of the North Valle cartel, said Adam Szubin, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control. OFAC will continue to dismantle the cartel's financial empire and expose its willing collaborators.

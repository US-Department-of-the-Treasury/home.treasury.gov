​ “After reading the Inspector General’s report issued yesterday, it became clear that the IRS needs new leadership to restore public trust and confidence in the Agency.  As the President noted, this type of misconduct at any agency, but especially the IRS, is inexcusable and unacceptable. And I will not tolerate it.   “Today, in order to begin the process of restoring trust in the IRS, I requested and accepted the resignation of the Acting Commissioner.  There is more work to do, and we will get it done by ensuring the IRS implements new safeguards and administers the tax code fairly and without bias.”   ###

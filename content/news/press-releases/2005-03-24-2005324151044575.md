Secretary Snow is in Wilmington, DE and Chester County, PA today to speak with local business leaders about the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve Social Security. We were reminded of the serious nature of the Social Security problem yesterday when the Social Security and Medicare Trustees issued its annual report on the financial health if the programs' trust funds. The numbers contained in the Social Security report leave little doubt that the system is financially unsustainable, and in need of expeditious and lasting change.

Today's announcement that the unemployment rate fell to 5.2% and 110,000 new jobs have been created is good news for the direction ofAmerica's economy. That makes for over 3 million new jobs since May 2003. President Bush is committed to keeping the economy on the path of healthy growth by cutting the deficit in half, enacting an energy policy, and strengthening social security. The President's leadership on economic policy is clearly moving the economy in the right direction.

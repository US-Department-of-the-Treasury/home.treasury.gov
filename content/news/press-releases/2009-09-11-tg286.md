The report released today by Treasury underscores the urgent need for comprehensive health insurance reform. While over 15 percent of Americans go without insurance in a given year, nearly fifty percent will go uninsured at some point over the next decade.   Every American who has lost a job and whose family has lost coverage knows the need for reform is real. Every insured American who has seen health care costs go up while their income and savings have gone down knows that reform is necessary. And as we emerge from the worst financial crisis in generations, it is undeniable that to bring down our long-term deficits, we must bring down the growth of long-term healthcare costs.

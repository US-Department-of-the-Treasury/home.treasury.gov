The original America West loan was issued onJanuary 18, 2002 in the amount of $429 million, of which $379.6 million was guaranteed by the ATSB.    At the time of the remarketing, the outstanding balance on the loan was $249.6 million, of which $227.7 million was guaranteed.  The loan was remarketed at par plus 1 percent.

Of the six loans guaranteed by the Board, four have been paid off in full or remarketed without the government guarantee.

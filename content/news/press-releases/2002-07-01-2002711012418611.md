Speaking today in New York City before the United Nations, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill stated that, with the right combination of aid and accountability - from both rich nations and poor ones - we can accelerate the spread of clean water, education, and healthcare throughout Africa and the developing world.   We can help create vibrant, self-sustaining economies founded on private enterprise, which will generate a rising standard of living.  Working together, the member states of the United Nations can go beyond eradicating poverty in the developing world, to achieving prosperity at last.  Not in the next generation, but right now.  President Bush said it best - there are no second class citizens in the human race.  We must make his vision into a worldwide reality.

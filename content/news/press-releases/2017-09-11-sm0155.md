As an American, and as a native New Yorker, memories of 9/11 stir deep emotions, even 16 years later. As we observe Patriot Day to honor those we lost that fateful day, our resolve to 'never forget' remains as strong as ever. At the Treasury Department, I lead a team of dedicated professionals working tirelessly every day to combat terrorist financing and constantly evolving threats across the globe.  I am humbled to work for the American people to protect our way of life, and our vital institutions and interests around the world, from those seeking to do us harm.

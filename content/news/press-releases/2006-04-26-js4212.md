Under Secretary for International Affairs Tim Adams will travel to India to attend the 39th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank in Hyderabad next week. The trip is an opportunity to highlight the importance that the U.S. places on the role of the Asia Development Bank in reducing poverty in the region as well as an opportunity to build on the U.S.-India partnership in a number of areas including continuing to work on ways to further capitalize on potential gains from expanded trading opportunities and more open financial markets in India.

Before arriving in Hyderabad, Adams will travel to Mumbai and Kolkata to meet with local financial and business leaders. Adams will also visit microfinance sites to discuss innovative approaches for getting capital in the hands of local entrepreneurs that may not have access to banks.

In Hyderabad, Adams will lead the U.S. delegation at the Asian Development Bank annual meeting where he will discuss key elements of the Bush Administration's development agenda, including the role of the private sector in reducing poverty in Asia, measuring concrete results and fighting corruption.

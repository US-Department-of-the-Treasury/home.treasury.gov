I applaud the House on today's passage of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act.



The overwhelming bipartisan support garnered by this proposal is a win for American workers, their families and the nation.



This legislation - which contains many of the provisions President Bush has been calling for since last October - will give immediate help to workers whose unemployment benefits will expire next Monday and it will add needed momentum so that we have a robust economic recovery.



It offers more than just an unemployment check for those out of work and those hurting, it offers the hope of a paycheck in the near future.



I urge the Senate to immediately pass this bill and get it to the President's desk for his signature.

U.S. Treasury Under Secretary John B. Taylor met today with the Minister of Finance and Technical Secretary of the President, Dr. Juan Jose Daboub, and with the President of the Central Bank, Mr. Rafael Barraza, to discuss themes of common interest in the context of aid and financing for development.

Dr. Taylor is touring Central America to discuss the importance of the private sector in generating economic growth and raising standards of living. This visit also coincides with internal discussions regarding the Bush Administration’s Millennium Challenge Account, which has the goal of encouraging the practices of ruling justly, investing in people, and economic freedom in developing countries.

Dr. Taylor will also visit the export processing zone, Miramar, an Infocentro training center, and a school, the Centro Escolar in the Milagro district in the city of San Marcos. The Under Secretary will also meet with the country’s principal business leaders during a working lunch. The goal of these visits is to provide him with an integrated panorama of the reality and challenges facing El Salvador. In his tour of the isthmus, Dr. Taylor will also visit Honduras and Nicaragua.

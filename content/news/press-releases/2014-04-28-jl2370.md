- During the April – June 2014 quarter, Treasury expects to pay down $78 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $130 billion. This pay down estimate is $38 billion higher than announced in February 2014.  The increase in the estimated pay down relates primarily to changes in cash balance assumptions[1].
 
- During the July – September 2014 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $169 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $130 billion.
 

During the January – March 2014 quarter, Treasury issued $265 billion in net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $142 billion.  In February 2014, Treasury estimated marketable borrowing of $284 billion assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $130 billion.  The decrease in borrowing was driven by higher receipts and lower outlays partially offset by a higher ending cash balance.

 

Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, April 30, 2014.

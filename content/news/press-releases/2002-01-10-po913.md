U.S. Treasurer Rosario Marin and U.S. Mint Director Henrietta Holsman Fore will join Tennessee Governor Don Sundquist on Monday, January 14, 2002 to unveil the new official Tennessee State Quarter.

The new coin features a trumpet, a fiddle, a guitar, and several musical notes, symbolizing the state's many contributions to American music, with the inscription Musical Heritage. Similarly, Tennessee's state flag has three stars representing each region of the state.

The Tennessee quarter is the 16th quarter released under the U.S. Mint 50 State Quarters(tm) Program, and the first quarter released in 2002.

The unveiling will take place on January 14, 2002 at the Country Music Hall of Fame's Ford Motor Company Theatre in Nashville, TN. The event will be held at 10:30 a.m. Central Time.

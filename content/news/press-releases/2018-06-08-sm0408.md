Washington
– U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today after the announcement of an IMF assistance package for Argentina:
“I welcome the announcement today that Argentina and the staff of the International Monetary Fund have reached agreement on a package of pro-growth economic policy reforms that can be supported by IMF financial assistance.  As President Trump has said, the United States supports President Macri’s vision for transforming his country’s economy and unleashing its growth potential.  We believe that Argentina’s economic and financial policies, including measures to enhance growth and protect the most vulnerable, warrant the strong backing of the international community.”

In his weekly radio address Saturday, President Bush discussed pursuing pro-growth economic policies that will allow us to reduce the deficit while keeping our economy strong. Since my Administration's tax relief was implemented four years ago, our economy has added more than eight million new jobs, and we've experienced 45 months of uninterrupted job growth. With more Americans working and more businesses thriving, our economy has produced record tax revenues. The Treasury Department recently reported that this year's Federal revenues are up eight percent over last year. As a result, our Nation's budget deficit is about one-third lower than it was at this time last year, said the President.

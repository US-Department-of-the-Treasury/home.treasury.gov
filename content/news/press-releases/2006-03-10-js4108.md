Today's employment report showing 243,000 new jobs in February is further evidence that the President's economic policies are working. Since the signing of the President's Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 we have seen consistent, strong employment growth totaling nearly five million new jobs. This is great news for American workers and families. We are clearly moving in the right direction, and I am confident that we will remain on a good path with continued labor market strength creating many good job opportunities for American workers in the days ahead.

Lower tax rates, especially on investment, lie at the heart of this strong expansion. The record is clear; now congress needs to act to extend the tax relief and make it permanent.

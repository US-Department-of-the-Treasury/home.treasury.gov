In a statement Friday morning on the February employment report, Treasury Secretary John Snow noted that February's employment report showing 243,000 new jobs in February is further evidence that the President's economic policies are working. Since the signing of the President's Jobs and Growth Act of 2003 we have seen consistent, strong employment growth totaling nearly five million new jobs. This is great news for American workers and families.

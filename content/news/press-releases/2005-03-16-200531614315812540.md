Secretary John Snow today praised the President's nomination of Paul Wolfowitz to be the next World Bank President. The tremendously important mission of the World Bank demands that it be led by an outstanding person; someone with proven leadership skills, management experience in large organizations, international diplomatic experience, real vision, a commitment and passion for development, and the knowledge of how to make it happen. Paul Wolfowitz meets and exceeds each and all of these criteria. He is a highly qualified candidate for this post, which is one of great magnitude and far-reaching consequences. I am proud to join the President in advancing this recommendation.

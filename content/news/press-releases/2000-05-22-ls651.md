FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-651



Special Representative of the German Chancellor, Otto Graf Lambsdorff and I are pleased that in our meeting today we were able to reach agreement on the reparations issue. We will insert the following into an executive agreement:


1. This agreement is intended to complement the creation of the Foundation and to foster all embracing and enduring legal peace for German companies with respect to the Second World War and the National Socialist era.
2. This agreement shall not affect unilateral decisions or bilateral or multilateral agreements that deal with the consequences of the Second World War and the National Socialist era.
3. The United States will not raise any reparations claims against Germany.
4. The United States shall take appropriate steps to oppose any challenge to the sovereign immunity of Germany with respect to any claim that may be asserted against Germany concerning the consequences of the Second World War and the National Socialist era.


The German Foundation legal working group will meet again in Berlin May 31. I am hopeful that we will resolve all remaining issues and plan a concluding plenary session later in June.

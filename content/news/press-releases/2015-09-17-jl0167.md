​**** **WASHINGTON **– “We strongly welcome the Ukrainian parliament’s decisive vote today in support of the debt restructuring agreement between the Ukrainian government and the Ad Hoc Creditors Committee.  This agreement will help to improve Ukraine’s public finances, provide the authorities with breathing room to execute their ambitious reform agenda, and strengthen the groundwork for economic recovery.  
“Today’s vote was the latest in a series of important measures taken by the Ukrainian government and parliament over the last year and a half to reform the Ukrainian economy and lay the foundation for growth.  Disciplined implementation of the full set of economic, anti-corruption, and governance reforms is critical to sustaining Ukraine’s positive momentum and unlocking further assistance from the international community.”

**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced that it would continue to wind down its investment in First BanCorp. by selling additional shares of common stock through a second pre-defined written trading plan. Earlier this week Treasury announced the completion of the first pre-defined written trading plan for First BanCorp. common stock. Under that plan, Treasury sold 4,388,888 shares and recovered approximately $22 million for taxpayers. Treasury currently holds 15,291,553 shares, or approximately 7.2 percent of First BanCorp. common stock. To date, taxpayers have recovered a total of $440.4 billion on TARP investments including the sale of Treasury’s AIG shares, compared to $426.3 billion disbursed. Of the 707 banks that received TARP investments through the Capital Purchase Program, only 34 remain in the program.

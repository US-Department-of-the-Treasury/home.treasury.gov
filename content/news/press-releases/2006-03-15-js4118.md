JS-4118

Some of the tables associated with Treasury's International Capital data release were inadvertently posted to the Treasury Web site early. The Department apologizes for any problems this may have caused. We believe that data releases should always occur in a reliable and predictable manner and will work to ensure that problems like this are not repeated.

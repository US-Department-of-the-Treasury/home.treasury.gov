LS-868



Today we took another major step forward toward an IRS that better serves the American people.



We applaud the Senate's confirmation of the Administration's IRS Oversight Board nominees. This board will help to strengthen the IRS so that it can better fulfill its important mission of collecting the nation's revenue, administering our tax laws, and providing the best possible service to taxpayers.



We congratulate the new IRS Oversight Board members and look forward to working closely with them to continue the many improvements now underway at the IRS.

WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury launched a web portal to allow eligible State, local, and tribal governments to receive payments to help offset the costs of their response to the coronavirus pandemic.

Once registered through this portal, States, territories, and the District of Columbia will receive promptly half of the funds allocated to them pursuant to the CARES Act.  This will fast-track the availability of $71 billion to meet immediate cash flow needs.  The remaining balance of the payment amounts due to States, eligible local governments, and tribal governments will be paid no later than April 24, 2020.

“Our State, local, and tribal partners across the country are facing unique challenges as they navigate the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.  “As part of our whole-of-government approach, we have moved with unprecedented speed to get these funds to those who need them a week ahead of schedule.”

Additional details regarding this program can be found at[Treasury.gov/CARES](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares).  Eligible governments should expect the funds to arrive in the account they designate in as little as 24 hours after providing the required information in the web portal.

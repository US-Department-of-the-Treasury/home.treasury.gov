About TIC Data   The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.  These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.  For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.  The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.  In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.  For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.   [Press notice TIC for August 2014](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/archive-documents/Press-notice-TIC-for-August-2014.pdf) **TIC Monthly Reports on Cross-Border Financial Flows** (Billions of dollars, not seasonally adjusted)                 12 Months Through                     2012 2013 Jun-13 Jun-14 Mar-14 Apr-14 May-14 Jun-14 **Foreigners' Acquisitions of Long-term Securities**         1 Gross Purchases of Domestic U.S. Securities 24593.4 27556.6 26034.8 27057.9 2487.4 2400.9 2254.9 2237.8 2 Gross Sales of Domestic U.S. Securities 23959.2 27473.2 25711.0 26858.1 2478.1 2414.9 2220.3 2256.1 **3 Domestic Securities Purchased, net (line 1 less line 2) /1 634.1 83.4 323.7 199.7 9.4 -14.0 34.6 -18.4 4 Private, net /2 408.2 4.7 132.5 149.4 3.0 -31.9 10.2 -44.6** 5 Treasury Bonds & Notes, net 206.6 51.3 -12.7 179.9 13.8 -32.4 5.3 -40.8 6 Gov't Agency Bonds, net 134.2 -3.7 69.3 2.8 -7.2 -2.4 2.8 -1.6 7 Corporate Bonds, net -31.0 -6.8 8.0 -23.8 5.5 -8.2 -9.0 -3.3 8 Equities, net 98.4 -36.1 68.0 -9.5 -9.1 11.0 11.0 1.1 **9 Official, net /3 225.9 78.8 191.2 50.3 6.4 18.0 24.4 26.3** 10 Treasury Bonds & Notes, net 209.9 -8.4 110.0 17.1 12.1 18.8 19.7 20.0 11 Gov't Agency Bonds, net -1.3 75.2 53.6 41.1 -1.4 0.3 3.7 5.0 12 Corporate Bonds, net 7.0 16.2 19.5 6.7 1.0 -0.3 1.2 -0.3 13 Equities, net 10.3 -4.1 8.2 -14.5 -5.2 -0.9 -0.2 1.5       14 Gross Purchases of Foreign Securities from U.S. Residents 7385.4 8157.1 7706.1 8672.7 813.6 779.9 779.2 810.4 15 Gross Sales of Foreign Securities to U.S. Residents 7406.7 8378.0 7851.9 8867.7 869.0 807.1 795.2 810.8 **16 Foreign Securities Purchased, net (line 14 less line 15) /4 -21.2 -220.9 -145.8 -195.0 -55.4 -27.2 -16.0 -0.4**       17 Foreign Bonds Purchased, net 19.9 -46.7 -35.2 -21.7 2.1 0.8 0.2 -13.2 18 Foreign Equities Purchased, net -41.1 -174.2 -110.6 -173.3 -57.5 -28.0 -16.2 12.8 **19 Net Long-term Securities Transactions (line 3 plus line 16): 612.9 -137.5 178.0 4.7 -46.0 -41.2 18.6 -18.7 20 Other Acquisitions of Long-term Securities, net /5 -237.2 -231.2 -265.4 -99.9 53.0 -10.3 -10.9 -11.5 21 Net Foreign Acquisition of Long-term Securities**     (lines 19 and 20): 375.7 -368.6 -87.4 -95.2 6.9 -51.6 7.7 -30.2 **22 Increase in Foreign Holdings of Dollar-denominated Short-term U.S. Securities and Other Custody Liabilities: /6 63.3 -36.6 48.5 -39.0 -3.5 -16.2 2.3 -5.7 23 U.S. Treasury Bills 16.3 21.6 45.3 -48.5 9.8 -41.6 -5.0 -15.9** 24 Private, net 0.8 -4.1 47.0 -26.8 14.5 -22.2 -1.8 4.3 25 Official, net 15.5 25.7 -1.7 -21.7 -4.7 -19.4 -3.2 -20.2 **26 Other Negotiable Instruments and Selected Other Liabilities: /7 47.0 -58.2 3.2 9.5 -13.4 25.5 7.2 10.2** 27 Private, net 47.9 -71.5 -2.2 -6.3 -12.7 23.8 6.0 9.3 28 Official, net -0.8 13.4 5.4 15.8 -0.7 1.7 1.2 0.9 **29 Change in Banks' Own Net Dollar-denominated Liabilities -60.2 561.2 380.4 229.4 -126.4 193.3 23.1 -117.6 30 Monthly Net TIC Flows (lines 21,22,29) /8 378.8 155.9 341.5 95.2 -123.0 125.6 33.1 -153.5 of which**     31 Private, net 238.6 70.0 227.9 46.9 -112.5 108.4 10.9 -156.9 32 Official, net 140.3 86.0 113.6 48.3 -10.5 17.2 22.2 3.4                             /1 Net foreign purchases of U.S. securities (+) /2 Includes international and regional organizations /3 The reported division of net purchases of long-term securities between net purchases by foreign official institutions and net purchases of other foreign investors is subject to a "transaction bias" described in Frequently Asked Questions 7 and 10.a.4 on the TIC website. /4 Net transactions in foreign securities by U.S. residents.

Treasury Secretary John Snow visited Volvo Powertrain North America yesterday to talk with employees and company managers about the American economy and the role of investment, including investment from abroad, in creating good jobs. We know that investment in America lies at the heart of creating good jobs, Snow said. This facility is a great example of the good that can come of global investment in the United States. Thanks to the Volvo investment, Hagerstown has retained and gained good jobs and tax revenue, and the research and technology being developed here will ultimately benefit all Americans.

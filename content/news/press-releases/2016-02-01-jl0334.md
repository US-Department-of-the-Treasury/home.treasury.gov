**View the Sources and Uses Table here. Washington, D.C.  --**The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of net marketable borrowing for the January – March 2016 and April – June 2016 quarters:

- During the January – March 2016 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $250 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $320 billion.  This borrowing estimate is $85 billion higher than announced in November 2015.  The increase in borrowing is due primarily to an increase in the cash balance and a larger financing need.[1](#_ftn1)
- During the April – June 2016 quarter, Treasury expects to pay down $112 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $350 billion.

During the October – December 2015 quarter, Treasury issued $354 billion in net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $333 billion.  In November 2015, Treasury estimated $344 billion in net marketable debt and assumed an end-of-December cash balance of $325 billion.  The modest net increase in borrowing was driven by an increase in the end-of-quarter cash balance.[1](#_ftn1)

Additional financing details relating to Treasury's Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, February 3, 2016.

Preliminary data from an annual survey of foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities at end-June 2004 are released today and posted on the U.S. Treasury web site at ([http://www.treas.gov/tic/fpis.html](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx)). Final survey results, which will include additional detail as well as revisions to the preliminary data, will be reported by June 30, 2005.

The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The most recent survey was for end-June 2003. Future surveys are scheduled to be carried out annually, and the next survey will be for end-June 2005.

A complementary survey measuring U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities will also be carried out annually. Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held at year-end 2004, are currently being processed. Preliminary results are expected to be reported by September 30, 2005.

**Washington, DC--** The Treasury Department released a statement from Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. today urging the House of Representatives to quickly enact the Senate-passed AMT patch.

I thank the Senate for passing a bill that prevents 21 million Americans from paying the Alternative Minimum Tax this year, and that does not raise other taxes.It is imperative that the House approve this and send it to the President without delay.We are only weeks away from the time when taxpayers can typically file their returns and will expect millions of dollars in refund checks quickly.The longer it takes to put this AMT patch into the law, the greater the delay in the filing season and those refunds.

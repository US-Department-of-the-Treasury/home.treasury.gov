These totals do not include the more than $2.5 billion delivered to U.S. territories for payment to territory residents.

“This Administration has delivered Economic Impact Payments to Americans in record time,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “More payments are on their way as we continue to deliver this much-needed relief to the American people.”

Treasury expects to deliver more than 150 million Economic Impact Payments in total. For state-by-state EIP figures,[click here](https://irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-release-latest-state-by-state-economic-impact-payment-figures).

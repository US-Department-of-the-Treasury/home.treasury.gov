I congratulate President Bush for committing funds today to prevent the transmission of AIDs from mothers to children in Africa and the Caribbean. When I traveled to South Africa last month, I went to a hospital that uses the nevirapine drug therapy to prevent transmission of the AIDs virus from mother to child. I met women there who were filled with joy that their infant children were HIV-free, and would live a longer, healthier happy life because of this drug treatment. The initiative President Bush announced today will bring treatment to a million additional mothers each year, and will bring children into the world with the potential for a longer, healthier life.

President Bush has said that our development assistance must get results and today he put our resources behind techniques proven to free infant children from near certainty of dying before the age of 5. Today’s announcement is an example of effective development assistance, and I hope our partners in development around the world will join us in this commitment to save children from a life shortened by AIDs. We have the technology. We know it works. Now is the time to bring it to those who need it most.

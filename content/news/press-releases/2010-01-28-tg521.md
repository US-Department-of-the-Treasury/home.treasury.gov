TG-521

**Geithner Tours Honeywell Factory, Meets with Local Business, Labor Leaders, Industry Representatives and Elected Officials  MINNEAPOLIS –**On the heels of the President's State of the Union call for a new jobs bill to jumpstart private sector job creation, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner traveled to Minneapolis today to meet with local business and labor leaders, industry representatives and elected officials to discuss the work being done in Minnesota to create green jobs.

After touring facilities at Honeywell Internation​​al, Inc., a company considered to be a leader in the implementation of manufacturing efficiency measures, Secretary Geithner participated in a roundtable discussion hosted by the company and the Mayors' Green Manufacturing Initiative. During the roundtable, the group discussed how investments in clean energy and energy efficiency present significant opportunities to create green manufacturing jobs in Minnesota and nationwide while helping move the country toward a green economy. Secretary Geithner also announced that the Administration's budget, to be released next week, will expand the Advanced Energy Manufacturing Tax Credit by $5 billion. This program provides a 30 percent tax credit for investments in the factories that will make the products to power the clean energy economy. In the process, it is helping assure that America leads the world not in just reducing greenhouse gases to protect the environment, but in making the products needed to accomplish that reduction. A full list of roundtable attendees is below.

We hope Congress will move quickly to pass a jobs bill including credit and tax cuts for small businesses; investments in innovation including clean energy technology; investments in road, bridge, rail and port projects; and policies to spur more exports of American manufactured products, said Secretary Geithner.

Following the roundtable discussion, Secretary Geithner had lunch in Minneapolis with local business leaders from Cargill, Cuisine Concepts & Franklin Bakery, General Mills, Hemisphere Restaurant Properties, Honeywell, Hormel Food Corp, and Land O'Lakes.

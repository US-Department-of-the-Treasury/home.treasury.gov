**Washington –** The findings from the annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2023 were released today and posted on the Treasury web site at https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/tic-forms-instructions/us-claims-on-foreigners-from-holdings-of-foreign-securities

The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

A complementary survey measuring foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities also occurs annually. Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held at end-June 2024, are being processed. Preliminary results are expected to be reported on February 28, 2025.

## Overall Results

This survey measured the value of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2023 as approximately $15.3 trillion, with $11.5 trillion held in foreign equity, $3.4 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities. The previous such survey, conducted as of year-end 2022, measured U.S. holdings of approximately $14.0 trillion, with $10.3 trillion held in foreign equity, $3.3 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities, and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.  The increase in U.S. holdings in 2023 was mainly in equity (see Table 1).

U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities by country at the end of 2023 were the largest for the Cayman Islands ($2.7 trillion), followed by the United Kingdom ($1.5 trillion), Canada ($1.4 trillion), and Japan ($1.2 trillion) (see Table 2).  These four countries attracted 44 percent of total U.S. portfolio investment, the same as the previous year.This survey is part of the International Monetary Fund’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey, an effort to improve the measurement of portfolio asset holdings.

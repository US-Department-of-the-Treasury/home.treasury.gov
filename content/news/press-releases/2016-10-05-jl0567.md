An Opportunity to Innovate:

Building Security into the Chips and Bits of our Financial Products, Services, and Institutions

Thank you for having me here today at the inauguration of the Cambridge Cyber Summit.  Congratulations to the Aspen Institute, MIT, and CNBC for launching this event and bringing together such a strong group of leaders from across government, academia, and industry to discuss the cyber threats to America’s security and prosperity, and how we can combat and reduce these threats through technological innovation.

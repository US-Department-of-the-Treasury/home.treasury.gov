KYIV – Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenksyy. Secretary Yellen commended President Zelenskyy for his leadership and resolve in the face of Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war. The Secretary welcomed President Zelenskyy’s ongoing actions to strengthen good governance and address corruption. Secretary Yellen discussed the ongoing U.S. economic support that helps Ukraine continue to be able to provide vital basic services to its people, including the first transfer of $1.25 billion out of $9.9 billion in U.S. budget support to be provided over the first three quarters of 2023. Secretary Yellen also highlighted the efforts of the U.S. and its global coalition to impose severe sanctions on Russia to degrade its war machine and limit the revenue it has to fund its brutal war. The Secretary expressed that the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes as it defends against Russia’s attacks and begins to rebuild a prosperous and free Ukraine.

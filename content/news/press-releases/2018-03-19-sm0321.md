**Washington**– The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced that Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin will attend the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina from March 19 – 20, 2018.

"The trip to the G-20 will focus on advancing the Trump administration's global economic agenda to level the playing field for U.S. companies and workers," said Secretary Mnuchin.

These discussions will also focus on combating the financial streams of terrorist groups, narcotics traffickers, and human rights abusers, as well as protecting against the illicit use of crypto currencies."

Treasury today announced that it will delay publication of the Semi-Annual Report to Congress on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies of our major trading partners in light of several upcoming, high-level international meetings: the G-20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting April 14-15, 2011; the Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank April 16-17, 2011; and the third U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED) in May.   Treasury last published the semi-annual report on February 4, 2011.​

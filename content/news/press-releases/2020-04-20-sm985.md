*SSA, RRB recipients with eligible children need to act by Wednesday to quickly add money to their automatic Economic Impact Payment*

**WASHINGTON** —The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service today urge social security and railroad retirement recipients who have qualifying children and did not file a 2018 or 2019 tax return to go to the IRS[Non-Filer](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here)tool by Wednesday, April 22, and enter basic information to receive the $500 per eligible child added to their automatic $1,200 Economic Impact Payment.

“Social security recipients will get their $1,200 automatically, but if they have dependents and did not file in 2018 or 2019, they need to use the[IRS Non-Filers](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here)tool as soon as possible to input information to get their $500 per child,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “If the IRS does not receive this essential information by Wednesday, their payment will be $1,200 and the $500 per child will be paid to them with a return filing for tax year 2020.”

Those receiving federal benefits – including Social Security retirement, survivor or disability benefits (SSDI), or Railroad Retirement benefits – who have qualifying children and who were not required file a tax return in 2018 or 2019 should go to IRS.gov and click on the[“Non-Filers:Enter Payment Info Here”](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here)button. The tool will request basic information to confirm eligibility, calculate and send the Economic Impact Payments:

- Full names and Social Security numbers, including for spouse and dependents
- Mailing address
- Bank account type, account and routing numbers (leave blank if you receive your benefits through Direct Express)

By entering this information, they can receive the $500 per dependent child payment automatically in addition to their $1,200 individual payment. Otherwise, their payment at this time will be $1,200. By law, the additional $500 per eligible child amount would be paid in association with a return filing for tax year 2020.

Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and veterans benefit recipients will have until a later date to provide their information in the[IRS Non-Filers](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here)tool.

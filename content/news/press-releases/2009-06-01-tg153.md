David Loevinger and David Dollar are both uniquely qualified to serve in these roles because of their deep expertise and extended experience in handling a broad array of U.S.-China economic affairs, said Secretary Geithner. David Loevinger's experience in areas such as financial regulation and macroeconomic policies, among others, and David Dollar's world renowned expertise in development economics and distinguished career at the World Bank will help strengthen the U.S.-China partnership in an economically challenging time.

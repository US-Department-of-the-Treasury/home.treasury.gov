I am delighted but not surprised by today's GDP announcement, which showed that the American economy grew at a rate of 3.8 percent in the first quarter of this year. This number illustrates that U.S. workers and businesses are producing more goods and services every day, and that is a terrific sign of economic health. This type of expansion means more opportunity for more American workers, particularly those who need jobs.

President Bush is committed to keeping the economy on the path of healthy growth by making his tax cuts permanent, reducing the burden of frivolouslawsuits, passing a national energy policy and saving and strengthening SocialSecurity.His economic agenda seeks to achieve an economy that will continue to be resilient and productive for generations to come.

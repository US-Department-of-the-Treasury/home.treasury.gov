In a speech to the Association for Advanced Life Underwriting this morning, Treasury Secretary John Snow recognized the fourth anniversary of the Social Security Commission that President Bush convened four years ago on May 2nd, 2001.



The bipartisan commission made recommendations to the President, who listened carefully to their recommendations in establishing his priorities for reform, Snow noted during his remarks, which focused primarily on reforming the financial unsustainable system.



This anniversary reminds us that the President has been courageously leading the discussion on this issue for yearsand that the time for action, for moving forward on saving and strengthening the system for future generations, isnow.

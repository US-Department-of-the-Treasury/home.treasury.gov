**Washington, D.C.--**The Treasury Department released a statement from Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. on final passage of a patch for the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT).

I thank the House for taking action today on an AMT patch that will protect millions of Americans from an unexpected tax increase this year.  With legislation now on the way to the President for his signature, the Internal Revenue Service can begin the remaining preparations for next year's filing season.

The IRS is doing all it can to have a fully successful filing season.  However, it is likely that there will be some delays, including delays of some refunds.  The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service will do everything possible to keep American taxpayers informed throughout the course of the upcoming filing season.

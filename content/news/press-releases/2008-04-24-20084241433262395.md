The President marks World Trade Week with remarks at the White House tomorrow. Quick passage of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will help level the playing field for American businesses, farmers, ranchers and workers, while demonstrating the U.S. commitment to open markets. Implementation of the FTA will provide market access for U.S. consumer and industrial products, with over 80% of U.S. exports receiving immediate duty-free status. In addition, the agreement will remove barriers to U.S. services and provide a secure and predictable legal framework for investors. The agreement will also strengthen protection for intellectual property, workers and the environment. More than 9,000 U.S. companies export to Colombia, most of which are small and medium-sized firms. Colombia has been both an important ally to, and trading partner with, the U.S.

**WASHINGTON **– Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen issued the following statement today:



The United States applauds Japan's designation of 11 entities and individuals involved in supporting North Korea's development of prohibited programs and proliferation activities.  Today's sanctions reflect President Obama's and Prime Minister Abe's February 2013 commitment to cooperate on sustaining global financial pressure on North Korea's illicit activities.



This action highlights the international community's resolve to implement UN Security Council Resolution 2094 and to prevent financial institutions like the Korea Kwangson Banking Corporation, the Korea Daesong Bank, and the Daedong Credit Bank, from facilitating transactions on behalf of actors linked to North Korea's proliferation network.



The United States will continue to work with our partners in the region and the international community as a whole in pursuit of our shared goal:  the peaceful denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.  We will likewise continue, consistent with our UN obligations, to target the financial institutions, front companies, and individuals supporting North Korea's illicit activities.



We look forward to continued close coordination and collaboration with the Japanese on this critically important objective.

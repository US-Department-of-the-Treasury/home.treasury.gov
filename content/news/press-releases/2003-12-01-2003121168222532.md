Treasury Secretary John Snow will travel to St. Louis, Missouri on December 5th to discuss the state of the economy, as well as efforts by President Bush to create jobs, strengthen the economic recovery and increase workers' standards of living. 

In St. Louis, Secretary Snow will tour a construction site, meet with local construction industry leaders, and tour a vocational school that is teaching students job skills.  The construction industry, an important segment of the overall U.S. economy, is showing signs of improvement.   The Commerce Department this week reported that construction spending increased 0.9 percent in October, to a record $922 billion annual rate.

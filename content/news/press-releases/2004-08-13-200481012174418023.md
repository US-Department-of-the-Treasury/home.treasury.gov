Secretary John Snow visited Southeastern Florida on Friday August 13th to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs, as well as control health care costs, reduce frivolous lawsuits and ensure that America has reliable and affordable sources of energy. As a result of the President's economic leadership, Florida has gained nearly 82,000 new jobs this year and more than 6.1 Florida taxpayers will have lower income tax bills in 2004, Snow said.

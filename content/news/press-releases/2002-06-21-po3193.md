I applaud the House for voting to make the pension and individual retirement provisions in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 permanent. This legislation enhances the retirement security of the more than 170 million workers in the labor force in 2011. I hope the Senate acts quickly to ensure that millions of hardworking Americans will continue to have greater opportunity to save for their retirement, stated Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill.

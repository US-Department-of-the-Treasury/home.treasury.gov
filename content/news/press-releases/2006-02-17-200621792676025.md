In a speech inChicagolast Thursday , Secretary John Snow reflected on recent meetings of the G8 inMoscowand emphasized the shared responsibility, among nations, for economic growth: The meetings inMoscowreminded me, as they often do, of the leadership responsibility of the United States. We are the undisputed economic leader of the world, and my G8 and G7 colleagues consistently look to our economic policies for direction when crafting their own. I'm encouraged by that, particularly considering the fact that we do face a growth imbalance in the world today. It is critical for our trading partners to stimulate economic growth in their countries.

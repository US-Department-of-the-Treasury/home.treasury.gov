**St. Charles – **U.S. TreasurySecretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today in response to President Trump's tax reform speech in St. Charles, Missouri:

Today the President returned to Missouri to speak to hardworking men and women and small business owners, who are the engines of job creation in our country, about how tax cuts and reform will bring better-paying jobs to Main Street in America.  We have the highest business tax rates in the developed world, and they have driven jobs and opportunities overseas.  That is why we are working with Congress to pass historic tax reform that will not only cut taxes for families, it will make our businesses more competitive and spur sustained economic growth that will benefit all Americans. **####**

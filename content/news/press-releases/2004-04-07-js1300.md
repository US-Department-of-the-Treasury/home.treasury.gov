I applaud the U.S. Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) for issuing guidance that will make it easier for employers to adopt Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Health Savings Accounts are designed to help individuals take more control over how their health care dollars are spent and save for future medical and retiree health expenses on a tax-free basis.



The Treasury Department will continue to issue the guidance that the private sector and industry needs to ensure that Health Savings Accounts will be available to all Americans.



For more information on HSAs, be sure to check out the Health Savings Account page on our website:[www.treas.gov](https://home.treasury.gov/). We have also set up an e-mail address –[hsainfo@treasury.gov](mailto:hsainfo@treasury.gov)– where you can submit questions, as well as a voice mailbox: 202-622-4HSA.

HP-344

The United States understands that the Macau authorities are prepared to unblock all North Korean-related accounts currently frozen in Banco Delta Asia. Based on previous discussions with Chinese, Macanese, and DPRK officials, as well as understandings reached with the DPRK on the use of these funds, the United States would support a decision by the Macau authorities to unblock the accounts in question. Throughout this process we have appreciated the consistent help, goodwill, and professionalism shown by the Macanese authorities and look forward to continued cooperation between the United States and Macau.

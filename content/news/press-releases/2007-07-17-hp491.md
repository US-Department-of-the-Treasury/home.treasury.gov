The reported division of net purchases of long-term securities between net purchases by foreign official institutions and net purchases   

of other foreign investors is subject to a "transaction bias" described in Frequently Asked Questions 7 and 10.a.4 on the TIC web site.   

/4
 
 
Net transactions in foreign securities by U.S. residents.   Foreign purchases of foreign securities = U.S. sales of foreign securities to foreigners.

Thus negative entries indicate net U.S. purchases of foreign securities, or an outflow of capital from the United States; positive entries

indicate net U.S. sales of foreign securities.

quarterly and published in the Treasury Bulletin and the TIC web site.

/8
 
 
TIC data cover most components of international financial flows, but do not include data on direct investment flows, which are collected  

and published by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis.    In addition to the monthly data summarized here, the

TIC collects quarterly data on some banking and nonbanking assets and liabilities.   Frequently Asked Question 1 on the TIC web   

site describes the scope of TIC data collection.

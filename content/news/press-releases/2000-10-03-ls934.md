The Administration respects the independence of the Federal Reserve in making decisions about our nation's monetary policy. We share the Federal Reserve's goals of maintaining healthy economic growth while preserving low inflation.

Supported by sound economic policies, including budget discipline, the economy continues to grow, with strong investment and higher productivity, creating good jobs and improved living standards for all Americans. We are committed to sustaining this economic success into the future.

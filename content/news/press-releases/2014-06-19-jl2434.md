As Prepared for Delivery

BERLIN, GERMANY - I would like to thank the Minister of Finance again for the warm welcome on my third trip to Germany as Secretary.  We have met every few months since I became Treasury Secretary and I deeply appreciate our close cooperation on the wide range of shared interests between the United States and Germany.

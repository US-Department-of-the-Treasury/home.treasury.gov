Treasury's Acting Assistant Secretary Lisa Ross and Deputy Assistant Secretary Ted Carter signed on Wednesday a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Treasury Office of Small Business Development and 17 small minority and women-owned trade associations. This marks the first federal agency agreement with such a large number of trade associations for the purpose of increasing procurement opportunities.



The MOU will improve the ability of these firms to compete for Treasury contracts and subcontracts in industries reflecting under-representation. The Treasury Department's relationships with the small business community have been greatly enhanced through these trade association outreach activities and mentor-protegee relationships.



Treasury's commitment to fostering economic development and excellence in our procurement process has resulted in this unprecedented agreement, Acting Assistant Secretary Ross said. This is a first in small business procurement.



A copy of the MOU and a list of the trade associations is attached.

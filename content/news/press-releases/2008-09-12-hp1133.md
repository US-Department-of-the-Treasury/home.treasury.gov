HP-1133

**Washington, DC** --The Treasury Department and the U.S. Small Business Administration today announced a new website that provides small businesses with information on how Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) can help meet their employees' health care needs.

While many Americans have access to health coverage through their employers, many employees work for small companies that are unable to sponsor health insurance plans.Many of these employees can benefit from the affordability and flexibility of HSAs and HSA-eligible health plans.

The new website,[www.hsa.gov](http://www.hsa.gov/), presents the advantages of HSAs, provides comparisons to other health coverage options, and has other materials to help employers and individuals determine whether and how to enroll in HSA-eligible coverage and how to save for health care costs through an HSA.

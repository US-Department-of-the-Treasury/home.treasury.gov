In a speech to the World Health Care Congress this afternoon, Treasury Secretary John Snow outlined the economic challenges thatAmericafaces when it comes to health care. Even with more people working than ever before, with homeownership at record levels and household wealth reaching an all-time high in the fourth quarter of last year – even with all this good news and prosperity, we still struggle with the cost of health care, Snow said.

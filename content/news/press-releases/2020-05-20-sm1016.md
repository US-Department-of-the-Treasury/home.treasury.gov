WASHINGTON
– U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today following the announcement of the Re-Proposed Capital Rule for the Enterprises by the Federal Housing Finance Agency:
“I commend Director Mark Calabria and the FHFA for their work on this issue.  Establishing regulatory capital requirements for both GSEs represents an important step toward bringing the conservatorships to an end.  Appropriate capitalization of the GSEs will be critical to protecting taxpayers, fostering market discipline, promoting stability in the housing finance system, and ensuring durable consumer access to mortgage credit.”

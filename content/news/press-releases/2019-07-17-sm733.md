**Washington** – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury expanded preventive care benefits that may be provided by high deductible health plans (HDHPs) for a range of chronic conditions. This expansion is in response to President Trump’s Executive Order on “Improving Price and Quality Transparency in American Healthcare to Put Patients First,” and the Administration’s work to enhance the ability of Americans to choose health coverage that is best for them.

“Cost barriers should not prevent those suffering from chronic conditions from getting the medical care they need. This more inclusive coverage will empower Americans to make the best healthcare decisions for themselves and their families,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “The Administration’s expansion of preventive care benefits and access to health savings accounts will enable more Americans to exercise greater control over their medical care.”

Individuals covered by an HDHP generally may establish and deduct contributions to a health savings account (HSA). The expanded list of preventive care benefits provided by an HDHP covers medical care services and prescription drugs for certain chronic conditions. Any medical care previously recognized as preventive care for these rules is still treated as preventive care.

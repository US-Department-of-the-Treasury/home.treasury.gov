The Deparment of the Treasury hosts the inagural meeting of the President's Council on Financial Literacy today. The council, announced by President Bush last month, brings together members of the business, faith and non-profit worlds to make recommendations as to how to improve financial education in the United States. The Council will advise the President and Secretary Paulson on ways to improve Americans' understanding of mortgages, credit cards, retirement planning and other financial tools. The Council will also recommend ways to better measure the progress of U.S. financial literacy.

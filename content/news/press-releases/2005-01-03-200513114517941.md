This weekend, America lost a great leader and a great intellect, and the people of California lost a great friend. I knew and worked with Congressman Matsui for three decades. I deeply admired and appreciated his knowledge, his compassion, and his ability to reach across the aisle to achieve progress for his country. He will be remembered fondly, and with tremendous respect, for all that he gave as both a public servant and as an individual. I especially appreciated the opportunity to work closely with him over the last two years and am grateful for all of the courtesies he extended to me.

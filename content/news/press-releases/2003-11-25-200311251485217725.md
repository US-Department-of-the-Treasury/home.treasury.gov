Today's reports of strong real GDP growth in the third quarter and improving consumer confidence are further evidence that the President's economic policies are moving the U.S. economy in the right direction. Growth cannot be expected to continue at such rapid rates, but on balance, these indicators are providing continued positive evidence that our economy is beginning to recover. And while this news is encouraging, our work will not be complete until we ensure that every American who wants a job can find a job. It will be important to make steady progress on President Bush's economic program to sustain growth and create jobs.

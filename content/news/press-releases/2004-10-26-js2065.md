JS-2065



The Air Transportation Stabilization Board (ATSB) has been in contact with ATA Airlines over the past several weeks as the carrier prepared for today's filing. The ATSB understands the issues confronting ATA and will work with the airline through the bankruptcy process to ensure that the taxpayers' interests are protected. The proposed sale of assets will be closely scrutinized by the Board to mitigate any additional risks the transaction may pose to taxpayers.

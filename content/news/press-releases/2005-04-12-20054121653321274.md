Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Mark Warshawsky testified today on pension plan reforms before the Senate Special Committee on Aging. The Administration's proposal is designed to put the defined benefit pension system on secure financial footing in order to safeguard the benefits that plan participants have earned and will earn in the future. We are committed to working with Congress to ensure that effective reforms that protect worker's pensions are enacted into law.

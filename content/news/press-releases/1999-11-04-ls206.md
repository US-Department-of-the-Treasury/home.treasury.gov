The Treasury Department on Thursday made available on its web site the United States'[response to the IMF's Questionnaire on Fiscal Transparency](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/report3088)and[Self-Evaluation Report on Fiscal Transparency](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/report3089).



The IMF questionnaire was developed to help countries assess how their fiscal management systems compare with the requirements of the code. The self-evaluation report was designed to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these systems. Treasury is releasing the United States' response in an effort to promote widespread implementation of the IMF's*Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency - Declaration on Principles*. Treasury also anticipates the transparency standards will become an integral part of the IMF's Article IV surveillance process.



The IMF's increased focus on promoting fiscal transparency is a response to an emerging consensus that fiscal transparency is a critical part of good governance. Greater transparency is expected to help markets better adjust to economic developments, minimize contagion and reduce volatility. The IMF's*Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency - Declaration on Principles *was approved by the Executive Board and endorsed by the Interim Committee in 1998 (publicly available on the IMF web site).

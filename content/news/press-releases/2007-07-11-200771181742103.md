Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. visited South America this week to reinforce our strong ties with Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile and to stress our stake in the economic success of Latin America. He met with finance ministers, heads of state, as well as local business leaders to discuss ideas on how to spread opportunity, reduce poverty, and build the middle class in the region and talk about what the United States is doing to help. These visits were his first to those countries as Treasury Secretary.

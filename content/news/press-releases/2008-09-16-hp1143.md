hp-1143 **Washington, DC-- Treasury issued the following statement by Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. on Federal Reserve actions surrounding American International Group:**

These are challenging times for our financial markets. We are working closely with the Federal Reserve, the SEC and other regulators to enhance the stability and orderliness of our financial markets and minimize the disruption to our economy. I support the steps taken by the Federal Reserve tonight to assist AIG in continuing to meet its obligations, mitigate broader disruptions and at the same time protect the taxpayers.

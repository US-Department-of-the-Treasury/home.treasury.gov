**Washington, D.C.**– Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. presented the President's Lifetime Volunteer Service Award to Clint Hogbin, Gwen Lee, Ethel S. Kennedy, and Rodney Stotts as part of the USA Freedom Corps Volunteer Service Recognition Program today. These individuals have answered the President's call to service by serving over 4,000 hours each to various volunteer activities over their lifetimes.

Clint Hogbin has been active in numerous recycling, solid waste and land preservation programs since 1992. In 2007, he alone worked 728 hours on these volunteer activities while working as an Information Technology Specialist at the IRS.

Gwen Lee has demonstrated the call to service by hosting information booths, stuffing information packages, and serving on committees promoting and encouraging good environmental practices. She recently rented a billboard on I-15 (in Utah) and posted pro-environmental messages, a different one each month for 12 months.

Ethel S. Kennedy, a founding and current board member of the Earth Conservation Corps, has used her considerable influence and passion to fight for the health of the Anacostia River by engaging the underserved young people of the Anacostia River communities. Kennedy negotiated with Pepco, the U. S. Department of Interior, and the District Government to help secure the Earth Conservation Corps' two environmental learning centers on the river, which to date has served over 50,000 youth and adults and 500 Earth Conservation Corps members.

In 1992, Rodney Stotts and eight other youth from Anacostia set the bar for environmental service by pulling 5,000 tires out of Lower Beaver Dam Creek. He also participated in re-introducing the bald eagle to the Anacostia Watershed after it had disappeared from the area for nearly 50 years. Stotts is now on staff at Earth Conservation Corps as Youth Program Coordinator and manages and coordinates the AmeriCorps program.

In his January 2002 State of the Union Address, President Bush called on all Americans to make a difference in their communities through volunteer service. He created USA Freedom Corps, an Office of the White House, to strengthen and expand volunteer service. Americans are responding to the President's Call to Service.

The President's Volunteer Service Award was created at the President's direction by the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. The Award is available to youth ages 14 and under who have completed 50 or more hours of volunteer service; to individuals 15 and older who have completed 100 or more hours; and to families or groups who have completed 200 or more hours.

Last month, 274,000 jobs were created and unemployment stayed below the average of the last three decades,a low 5.2%, even with a welcome rise in the participation rate.This illustrates President Bush's Jobs and Growth agenda has again produced results for Americans. Altogether, about 3.5 million jobs have been created since May 2003, with roughly 2.2 million in the past 12 months.This is more evidence of the underlying strength and resilience of the American economy.

President Bush is committed to keeping the economy on the path of healthy growth by cutting the deficit in half, enacting an energy policy, and strengthening social security.The President's leadership on economic policy is clearly moving the economy in the right direction.

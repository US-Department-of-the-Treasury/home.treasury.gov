President Bush participated in a HOPE NOW roundtable Friday followed by a tour of a mortgage counseling facility in Freehold, New Jersey. Novadebt is a housing counseling agency approved by HUD and a participant in the HOPE hotline, 888-995-HOPE. Homeowners who call the hotline number are connected to free counseling services by trained non-profit counselors. (Paulson pictured here at a townhall discussion on housing late last year.)

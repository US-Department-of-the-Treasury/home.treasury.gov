The National Security Strategy released by the President today underscores the focus of Treasury’s work - in an ever more interconnected global economy, we are dedicated to helping level the playing field for American workers by advancing an open environment for trade and investment that promotes opportunity for all. This effort to grow the global economy supports U.S. national security interests and foreign policy goals.

Through our international engagements, including through our bilateral partnerships, at the International Monetary Fund, and through the multilateral development banks, we prioritize opening markets for U.S. goods, services, and investment, while leading efforts to promote sustainable development, and to reduce extreme poverty.

The strategic deployment of Treasury’s unique financial tools helps achieve a range of national security goals, including those highlighted in the National Security Strategy such as combatting terrorism, preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, supporting stability in Ukraine, reinforcing respect for international law, and promoting democracy and support for human rights.

A strong global economy is good for the United States, just as a strong U.S. economy is good for the global economy. Treasury’s international efforts are key to promoting job growth, prosperity, and security at home – and abroad.

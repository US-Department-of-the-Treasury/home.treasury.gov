The Treasury Department began sending stimulus payments to millions of American households last month via direct deposit or paper check. The vast majority of direct deposits have now been completed, and Treasury continues to print and mail stimulus checks in large volumes on a weekly basis.The vast majority of payments will be out by the end of June. The stimulus package, signed by the President in early February, also includes short-term incentives to bolster business investment and consumer spending. Those who have not yet filed a tax return should do so to receive a stimulus payment by the end of the year. By the end of June nearly 130 million stimulus payments should be in the hands of Americans, providing an immediate boost to the economy and helping to create more than 500,000 new jobs by the end of the year, said Paulson.

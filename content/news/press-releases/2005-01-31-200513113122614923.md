U.S. Mint Director Henrietta Holsman Fore joined Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger at the California State History Museum to launch the California commemorative quarter-dollar today. The reverse design on the new quarter depicts naturalist and conservationist John Muir admiring Yosemite Valley's Half Dome. Soaring amid the scene is a California condor. The coin bears the inscriptions California, John Muir, Yosemite Valley and 1850.

**Atlanta, GA-**Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. presented the President's Volunteer Service Award to Charles Bruce, Andrea Eva and Dr. Michael Petelle as part of the USA Freedom Corps Presidential Volunteer Service Recognition Program today in Atlanta, Georgia. Both Bruce and Eva have served countless hours at Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites while Dr. Petelle has dedicated his time to improving the environment.

Charles Bruce has been a volunteer with the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program since 1998.  Under his leadership over the past nine years, thousands of low-income individuals have received free tax preparation and e-file services. Bruce is currently the Site Coordinator for one of the premiere sites in Metro-Atlanta – Clarkston Library.  Andrea Eva serves as the Community Affair Committee Director of the National Association of Black Accountants, which adopted the Westend Mall Volunteer Income Tax Assistance site as a community service project. She took the lead in training all new preparers for the site, developed a refresher class for the professionals and increased the volunteer lifeline. Dr. Michael Petelle has spent his life involved in improving the environment, going back to high school when he single-handedly planted 3600 trees to forest a pasture. Petelle has sponsored the environmental club SAVE at North Cobb High School for 16 years where they recycle, plant trees, organize clean-ups and monitor water quality in local lakes and streams.  Each award recipient has individually dedicated more than 4,000 hours of volunteer service over their lifetime.

In his January 2002 State of the Union Address, President Bush called on all Americans to make a difference in their communities through volunteer service. He created USA Freedom Corps, an Office of the White House, to strengthen and expand volunteer service. Americans are responding to the President's Call to Service. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 61 million Americans volunteered in 2006.

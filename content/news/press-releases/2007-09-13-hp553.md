**Washington --** Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. issued the following statement today on the Independent Review Panel's report of theWorld Bank's Department of Institutional Integrity (INT), chaired by Paul Volcker.

I join World Bank President Zoellick in welcoming this report and would like to thank Chairman Volcker and his panel for their invaluable contribution to this essential work. The panel's report makes clear that fighting corruption is critical to fulfilling the Bank's core mission of economic development and poverty reduction around the world, that the INT must continue to play a central role in this effort and that more work is needed to integrate its work into the Bank's operations effectively and consistently.  I look forward to working closely with other shareholders and President Zoellick as he carries this vital work forward.

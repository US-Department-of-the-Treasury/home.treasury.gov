HP-911

  

I urge the U.S. Congress to show support for the Colombian people and provide greater hope for their future by passing the Colombian free trade agreement without further delay. Congressional approval of the Colombian free trade agreement will reinforce democracy in Latin America by showing support for a key ally who has made significant advancements to combat violence and instability. Leveling the playing field for American farmers, ranchers, and the more than 9,000 U.S. companies exporting to Colombia will also help strengthen our nation's economy.

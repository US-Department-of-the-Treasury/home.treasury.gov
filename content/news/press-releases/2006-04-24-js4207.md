Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral will teach a class on personal savings for ninth-graders from Woodrow Wilson High School to kick off National Teach Children to Save Day on Tuesday, April 25 and to participate in National Volunteer Week.

The Treasury Department and the American Bankers Association Education Foundation once again are partnering for the 10th annual Teach Children to Save Day.  This is Treasury's third year participating in the day's events, when officials and bankers connect with thousands of students in classrooms and after-school programs to share real life lessons about money. Secretary Snow and ten department officials and staff will volunteer their time with America's elementary and high school students that day.

WASHINGTON – On Friday, July 12, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury is hosting the annual Freedman’s Bank Forum featuring U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo, Governor Roy Cooper, Biden-Harris Administration officials, and key leaders from the public, private, nonprofit, and philanthropic sectors. The Forum will highlight the Administration’s continued efforts to increase economic opportunity for communities of color and spotlight local success stories in and around Raleigh, N.C., home to one of 19 original Freedman’s Bank branches.

The Freedman’s Savings and Trust Company was established in 1865 to provide newly emancipated Black Americans with the financial tools to safeguard their earnings, build financial security, and generate family wealth. In 2015, then Treasury Secretary Jack Lew christened the Treasury Annex building, which was built on the site of the “Freedman’s Bank Building” and launched an annual conference to showcase strategies to address racial economic disparities.

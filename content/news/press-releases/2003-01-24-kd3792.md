The Treasury Department today will begin posting to its web site the agenda for the meetings Treasury officials and staff traditionally hold with the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks primary dealers prior to each Quarterly Refunding.
The meetings with the primary dealers are arranged by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, acting as Treasurys fiscal agent.  In an effort to promote greater transparency, the agenda for the primary dealer meetings will be posted on Treasurys web site ( [http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/index.html](http://www.treas.gov/offices/domestic-finance/debt-management/index.html)) a week prior to the dealer meetings.  Market participants and observers also are welcome to respond to these questions via email at the address below.
Also, as mentioned at Treasurys last quarterly refunding press conference, other policy issues under discussion include efforts to:
promote investor interest in inflation-indexed securities.
reduce the costs associated with short-term fluctuations in cash balances. 
study the effects of heightened volatility on debt issuance. 
Please send comments and suggestions on these subjects or others relating to debt management to [debt.management@treasury.gov](mailto:debt.management@treasury.gov).

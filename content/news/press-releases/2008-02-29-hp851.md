Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. will travel to California next week to discuss a range of issues critical to the global and U.S. economies and financial markets.

Paulson will be joined by U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral as well as members of the President's Financial Literacy Council for a discussion on financial education with community leaders in Oakland on Thursday.  The group will discuss the importance of increasing financial education in the U.S., especially given the challenges many homeowners are facing today.

On Friday Paulson will discuss economic issues with local representatives of companies listed on the NASDAQ. To highlight the importance of clean energy technology to the environment and the economy, Paulson will tour the headquarters of an energy company and meet with employees there working on innovative solutions. In a speech that evening Paulson will address the 2008 Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research Economic Summit.

Report-3071

As depository institutions, most credit unions are small, retail-oriented operations that focus primarily on providing consumer credit to their members.   However, credit unions may also make business loans to their members.   As of June 30, 2000, federally insured credit unions had $4.3 billion in member business loans outstanding.   About 14 percent of federally insured credit unions had member business loans outstanding on that date.

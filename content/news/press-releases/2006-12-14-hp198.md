**Washington, DC–** Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson issued the following statement on the resignation of Treasury Fiscal Assistant Secretary Don Hammond:

Don Hammond's 23-year career at the Treasury Department has been marked by integrity, collegiality, and total dedication to the American people. Don is a public servant in the best sense of the term, always putting the needs of the public first. His efforts have made the Department more responsive to public needs and more efficient in meeting its responsibilities.

As Fiscal Assistant Secretary for the past nine years, Don has been the key player in managing the government's cash flow and overseeing financial management activities. And his role as liaison with the Federal Reserve has no doubt prepared Don well for his next position.

Don's deep knowledge of American financial operations and his cheerfulness in carrying out his duties have made him a valued and much-admired colleague. I wish Don all the best as he starts the next chapter in his distinguished public service career.

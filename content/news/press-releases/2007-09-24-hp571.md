I have had many conversations with members of Congress in both parties, inviting them to discuss Social Security reform with no preconditions. While differences over personal accounts and taxes dominate the public debate over this issue, in my conversations I found that there are many other things on which people agree. Everyone I talked with recognizes the seriousness of the problem, and most agreed on some of the principles and policies that must be part of the solution.

To build on these discussions, Treasury will release a series of issue briefs that will focus on areas of common ground, and provide straightforward analysis of the challenges facing Social Security and the implications of potential reforms.

By focusing first on areas of agreement, I hope these issue briefs will narrow the divide and spur further discussions of reform.

On Wednesday, December 15th, Treasury Secretary John Snow will moderate a panel during the White House conference on the economy focusing on tax and regulatory burdens.  The Secretary's panel will discuss the burdens and costs that taxes and regulations place on our economy, their impact on America's businesses and families, and the need for pro-growth measures to ease this drag on our economy.   The goal of the conference is to discuss the current status of our economy and ways we can ensure continued growth and job creation, and remain the most competitive economy in the world.

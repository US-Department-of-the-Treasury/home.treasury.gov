Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Pam Olson and IRS Chief Counsel B. John Williams will hold a background briefing on tax shelter regulations on Thursday, February 27, 2003 at 12:00 pm in room 4121 (the new media room). This session will provide a synopsis of final regulations that apply to the disclosure of potentially abusive tax avoidance transactions and will also allow for a Question and Answer session with Tax Policy staff. No cameras will be admitted-- this is a “pen and pad” only briefing.

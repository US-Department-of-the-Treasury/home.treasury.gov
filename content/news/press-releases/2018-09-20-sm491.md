U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today on the release of President Trump’s National Cyber Strategy:
“Treasury plays a key role in implementing the National Cyber Strategy by helping to safeguard the financial system against malign cyber activity and confronting and countering those that perpetrate it.
“Treasury has used its cyber sanctions authorities to impose costs on Russia, North Korea, Iran, and others for a wide range of behavior, such as attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyber attacks, and intrusions into U.S. critical infrastructure.
“Treasury works closely with private sector partners to enhance the security and resilience of the financial system and institutions through information sharing, the promulgation of best practices, and efforts to enhance response and recovery.
“These efforts shine a light on malicious cyber practices, hold those involved to account, strengthen and safeguard the financial system, and amplify the actions of our partners in the National Security Council and allies abroad.”

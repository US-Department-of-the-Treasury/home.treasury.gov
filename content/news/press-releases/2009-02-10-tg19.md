**Washington, DC --**The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today designated 26 companies and 14 individuals tied to Peruvian drug kingpin Fernando Zevallos Gonzales.  This financial network, based in Peru, Panama and the British Virgin Islands, is now subject to financial sanctions pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act).Our action demonstrates the importance of following the changing networks of major drug kingpins, like Fernando Zevallos, said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin.This designation identifies additional front companies and supports the Peruvian authorities' ongoing efforts to shut down the Fernando Zevallos criminal organization.Fernando Zevallos Gonzales, currently imprisoned in Peru, has been a major figure in Peruvian narcotics trafficking activities since 1980.On June 1, 2004, President Bush namedFernando Zevallos Gonzalesas a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Kingpin Act.At the same time, OFAC blocked, pending investigation, six companies and six individuals, including the Peruvian airline Aerocontinente S.A.On November 10, 2004, OFAC formally designated Aerocontinente S.A., which subsequently changed its name to Nuevo Continente S.A.Finally, on July 27, 2007, Fernando Zevallos Gonzales was indicted on money laundering and multiple violations of the Kingpin Act in the Southern District of Florida.

Despite Fernando Zevallos Gonzales's imprisonment, the OFAC sanctions investigation found that his financial network has continued to function under the leadership of key family members and close business associates.Key Fernando Zevallos family members designated today include his sisters Lupe Maritza Zevallos Gonzales, Sara Marilyn Zevallos Gonzales, Maria del Rosario Zevallos Gonzales, and Milagros Angelina Zevallos Gonzales; his brother Winston Ricardo Zevallos Gonzales; and his mother, Sara Maria Gonzales Garbancho de Zevallos.Key business associates designated today are Maximo Zadi Desme Hurtado, John Ivan Mejia Magnani, Ricardo Hernandez San Martin, Jose Manuel Mejia Regalado, Enrique Canaval Landazuri, Luis Miguel Carrillo Rodriguez, Percy Dangello Aranibar Castellanos, and Jorge Portilla Barraza.The financial network designated today principally consists of aviation and travel companies in Peru, including four air transportation service companies -*Aviandina S.A.C., Lasa Peru S.A.C., Vuela Peru S.A.C, *and*Transportes Aereos Unidos Selva Amazonica S.A.*; three travel agencies -*Peru Global Tours S.A.C*.,*Oriente Tours S.R.L*., and*Representaciones Oriente Tours S.R.L*.In addition, two aviation cleaning service companies -*Lucero Import S.A.C.*and*Peru Total Market E.I.R.L*., and two printing press companies -*Editora Transparencia S.A*. and*Empresa Editora Continente Press S.A. *were designated*.   *Finally, the **OFAC investigation targeted key offshore companies in Panama*-**Bellosom Enterprise Inc*. and*Blissey Panama Inc*. and the British Virgin Islands -*La Crosse Group Inc. *that supported the Fernando Zevallos financial network.This action is part of ongoing efforts under the Kingpin Act to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers worldwide.Including today's action, 580 entities and individuals associated with 75 drug kingpins have been designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act since June 2000.Today's designation would not have been possible without key support from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Miami Field Division.

Today's action freezes any assets the designated individuals may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions involving those assets.Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1,075,000 per violation to more severe criminal penalties.Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines of up to $5 million.Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million.Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code.

**WASHINGTON** –In support of President Hadi and the Yemeni government’s efforts to better meet the aspirations of all Yemenis and set their country on the path to stability and prosperity through economic reform and development, the United States is pleased to announce the approval of a $30 million contribution to Yemen’s Social Welfare Fund.  This assistance underscores the United States’ commitment to a comprehensive partnership with Yemen to support meaningful reform through the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative process and address mutual security challenges.

The United States commends President Hadi and the Yemeni government on reform measures taken to stabilize the country’s economy and better address the needs of Yemen’s citizens.  We will stand with the international community to support Yemen in its continued economic reform and development process to fulfill the vision of the National Dialogue and GCC Initiative.  Yemen’s economic strength will be the foundation of a prosperous and secure future.

Since the beginning of Yemen’s transition in November 2011, U.S. assistance to Yemen has totaled over $800 million.  The United States remains committed to continuing to support the Yemeni people throughout the transition process and beyond.

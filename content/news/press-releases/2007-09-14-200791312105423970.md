Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. traveled to Chicago to discuss the importance of trade and investment for U.S. job creation and economic growth. The Secretary met with Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago, a counseling agency that helps area homeowners avoid foreclosure. He and Regina Garrett, left, a Chicago resident who received assistance though the agency, spoke about the services these organizations can offer to help Americans keep their homes. President Bush recently tasked Secretary Paulson and HUD Secretary Jackson to reach out to groups that offer foreclosure counseling and refinancing for homeowners with the goal of expanding mortgage financing options, identifying homeowners before they face hardships, helping them understand their financing options, and assisting them in finding a mortgage product that works for them.

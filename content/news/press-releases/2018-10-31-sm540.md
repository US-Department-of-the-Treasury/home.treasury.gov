**Washington** – The findings from the annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2017 were released today and posted on the Treasury web site at[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx).

The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

A complementary survey measuring foreign holdings of U.S. securities is also conducted annually.  Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held at end-June 2018, are currently being processed.  Preliminary results are expected to be reported on February 28, 2019.

Overall Results

This survey measured the value of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2017 as approximately $12.4 trillion, with $9.1 trillion held in foreign equity, $2.8 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $0.5 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.  The previous such survey, conducted as of year-end 2016, measured U.S. holdings of approximately $9.9 trillion, with $7.1 trillion held in foreign equity, $2.4 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities, and $0.3 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.  The increase during 2017 occurred mainly in equity.

U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities by country at the end of 2017 were the largest for the Cayman Islands ($1.77 trillion), followed by the United Kingdom ($1.47 trillion), Japan ($1.13 trillion), and Canada ($996 billion) (see Table 2).  These four countries attracted 43 percent of total U.S. portfolio investment, versus 43 percent the previous year.

The surveys are part of an internationally coordinated effort under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to improve the measurement of portfolio asset holdings.

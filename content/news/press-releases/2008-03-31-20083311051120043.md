Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. today released the Treasury's Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure. We should and can have a structure that is designed for the world we live in, one that is more flexible, one that can better adapt to change, one that will allow us to more effectively deal with inevitable market disruptions and one that will better protect investors and consumers, said Secretary Paulson in remarks at the Treasury Department. The challenge is to evolve to a more flexible, efficient and effective regulatory framework – and that is the purpose of this Blueprint.

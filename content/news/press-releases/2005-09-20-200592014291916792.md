In a speech to the National Association of Federal Credit Unions today, Treasury Secretary Snow said: I meet and work with financial leaders every day, and it has not escaped my notice that credit unions tend to have great heart. That's especially important during times like these, when financial structure and resources are so very important to our fellow Americans, our brothers and sisters who have survived – and are surviving the aftermath of – Hurricane Katrina.

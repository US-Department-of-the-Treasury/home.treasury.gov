Secretary John Snow said today that Treasury officials are proud to be partnering with the American Bankers Association Education Foundation to teach young people all over the country today about the advantages of using credit wisely. A smart use of credit can open up a world of opportunities and establish a solid financial foundation for a lifetime, and it's important to learn about both the risks and the advantages of credit at a young age since credit is more widely available to young people than ever before.

Secretary John Snow will visit Grand Rapids, Michigan on Friday, August 27 to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. As a result of the President's economic leadership, we have overcome a recession and seen 11 straight months of job creation, totaling nearly 1.5 million new U.S. jobs since August 2003, said Secretary Snow. The President's tax reform policies have ensured that more than 3.6 million Michigan taxpayers will have lower income tax bills in 2004.

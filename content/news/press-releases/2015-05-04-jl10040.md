- During the April – June 2015 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $59 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $260 billion.  This borrowing estimate is $66 billion higher than announced in February 2015.  The increase in borrowing relates primarily to the increase in the end-of-quarter cash balance assumption partially offset by a decrease in the financing needs [1].

- During the July - September 2015 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $66 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $175 billion.

During the January – March 2015 quarter, Treasury issued $141 billion in net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $100 billion.  In February 2015, Treasury estimated $155 billion in net marketable debt and assumed an end-of-March cash balance of $100 billion.  The decrease in borrowing was driven primarily by higher receipts partially offset by higher outlays.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 6, 2015.

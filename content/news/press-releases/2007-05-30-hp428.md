I welcome the President's nomination of Bob Zoellick to lead the World Bank.  The World Bank's structure and mission require a leader with a proven track record of working with colleagues around the world to get results.  Bob Zoellick will bring that experience, as well as a passion for development, to the job.



Bob believes deeply in the mission of the World Bank, and has the trust, respect, and support of governments in all regions of the world.  His leadership will ensure that the World Bank continues to focus on its mission, helping nations across the globe invest in their people and lay the foundation for economic growth so as to reduce poverty and bring opportunities to all their citizens.

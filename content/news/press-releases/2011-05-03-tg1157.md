**Nominee for Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing As Prepared for Delivery** Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Shelby, and distinguished Members of this Committee:Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.It is a tremendous personal and professional honor to have been nominated for the position of Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing.I would like to thank President Obama for the confidence he has shown in me by nominating me, and Secretary Geithner for recommending me, for this important position.If confirmed, I will certainly work my hardest to meet their high expectations.

I know time is short, but if you permit me, Mr. Chairman, I would like to introduce the members of my family who are here today – my parents, Gary and Lillian Glaser, my wonderful wife Laura, and our son Ethan.Their love and support over the years have been indispensable, and are an important part of why I am able to sit before you today.

Mr. Chairman, over the course of my career I have served in the area of illicit finance under six Secretaries of the Treasury across three Presidential Administrations.My positions have included serving as an attorney in the U.S. Secret Service Chief Counsel’s Office, Senior Counselor for Financial Crimes within the Treasury Department’sOffice ofGeneral Counsel, Director of the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Section within Treasury’s Office of Enforcement, Director of Treasury’s Executive Office for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, and since 2004, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes within Treasury’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.Additionally, I have served, since September 2001, as the head of the U.S. Delegation to the Financial Action Task Force – the premier international body that sets anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards and works for their global adoption and implementation.I believe this experience has left me well prepared to take on this new position.

Over the course of these years, I am proud to have been part of the team that has built something new and unique at the Treasury Department – a finance ministry with a central role in the development and implementation of national security policy.This evolution began in the late 1990s with Treasury’s leading role in the development of the first National Money Laundering Strategies, and culminated in March 2004 with the creation of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).TFI brings together a broad and diverse range of Treasury’s authorities and expertise for two goals:protecting the U.S. and international financial systems from abuse, and identifying, disrupting, and dismantling the financial networks that support terrorist groups, organized crime, weapons proliferators, and countries that threaten the national security of the United States.This new approach has been successful.We have made it harder for terrorist groups to raise and move funds, disrupted the financial networks that support drug trafficking organizations, and applied substantial financial pressure on regimes such as Iran and North Korea, while at the same time making it more difficult for them to acquire the material necessary to develop their nuclear programs.

As the central policy office within TFI, the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC) works to develop and implement strategies, and engages with multilateral bodies, foreign government counterparts and private sector colleagues, to achieve all of these objectives.If confirmed, I will lead TFFC in continuing to develop innovative approaches to undermining illicit finance and strengthening our national security.Challenges abound.From Iran’s and North Korea’s nuclear programs and other illicit activities, to drug trafficking and criminal organizations in the Western Hemisphere and Eastern Europe, to global terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda and Hamas, to the new challenges posed by recent developments in the Middle East – never has it been more important to strategically and effectively marshal our financial tools and those of our allies in support of international security.

In closing, I would like to thank the Committee for its time and consideration.If confirmed, I pledge to work closely with you, Mr. Chairman, and other Members of the Committee and your staff to advance our collective goal of combating illicit finance and protecting America.It is my immense honor to sit here before you today and I would be happy to respond to any questions you or other Members of the Committee may have.​

The Treasury Department today held the first auction of a new U.S. government security, the 20-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). TIPS provide individual and institutional investors with a new option to increase the diversity of their investment portfolio, and like all U.S. Treasury securities, TIPS are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, said Brian Roseboro, Under Secretary for Domestic Finance.

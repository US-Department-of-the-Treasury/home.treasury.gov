*Snow Commends President Bush’s Vision for **Hastening the Day** Cuba** is Free and Democratic*

President Bush and the Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba released an initial report today outlining stepped up measures to choke off dollars funneling into the Castro regime while accelerating the day whenCuba is free.

“This Administration seeks freedom, democracy and prosperity for the Cuban people,” said U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow.  “These efforts will tighten the regime’s access to capital, hastening the end of Castro’s reign and weakening the iron grip he uses to choke-hold and subjugate his people.”

Today’s report outlined several key efforts to help expedite the day when Castro’s dictatorship no longer controls the freedom-hungry people of Cuba, prepare the country for a post-Castro, democratic existence and assist the Cuban people in establishing a free market economy.  This framework includes:

àHastening Cuba’s Transition

àMeeting Basic Human Needs in Health, Education, Housing and Human Services

àEstablishing Democratic Institutions, Respect for Human Rights, Rule of Law and National Justice and Reconciliation

àEstablishing the Core Institutions of a Free Economy

àModernizing Infrastructure

àIdentifying and Addressing Environmental Degradation

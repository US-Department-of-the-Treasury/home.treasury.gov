Undersecretary for International Affairs John Taylor welcomed the decision by the North American Development Bank to authorize $80 million for water conservation and $11 million for construction along the US-Mexico border. Today, the NADB Board made substantial progress in fulfilling the goals of President Bush and President Fox, stated Taylor, who serves as chairman of the NADB Board.

The reforms, the provision of grants for water conservation and the doubling of the size of the Low Interest Rate Lending Facility will make a real difference for people, communities and farms on our border.

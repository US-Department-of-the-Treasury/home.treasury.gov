HP-362



Over the past four years Mark Everson has held one of the toughest jobs in the country: Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service-the nation's tax collector.



In those four years Commissioner Everson has taken up the challenge of both increasing enforcement activities to deal with those who don't pay their fair share of taxes, while, at the same time, significantly improving the services and outreach activities the IRS provides to taxpayers.



I want to thank Commissioner Everson for his hard work and service over the past four years.  I wish him well in his new position at the American Red Cross.

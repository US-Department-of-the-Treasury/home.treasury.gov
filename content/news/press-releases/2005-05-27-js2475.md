The Treasury is preparing to bid farewell to a highly valued member of its team. Gregory Zerzan has served in Treasury's Office of Domestic Finance since March of 2003, first as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Policy and currently as Acting Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions. His expertise and contributions on legislative and policy matters involving financial institutions have been invaluable, and he has been a highly effective leader within the Office of Domestic Finance, as well as among the Treasury management team. Greg's sharp mind and engaging personality will be missed by his colleagues and staff, and I speak on behalf of the Department in saying we wish him the very best in his future endeavors.

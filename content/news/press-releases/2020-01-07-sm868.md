Washington
– U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement after Jovita Carranza’s confirmation as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA).
“I commend the Senate for its overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, 88-5, to confirm Jovita Carranza as the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. At the Treasury Department, Jovita worked to advance a pro-growth agenda that led to the strongest economy in generations and helped promote prosperity through financial literacy. I look forward to working with Jovita in her new role, and I know that her experience will prove invaluable as she advances the SBA’s mission to start, build, and grow businesses around the United States of America. ”
Carranza currently serves as the Treasurer of the United States, and prior to that appointment, served as Deputy Administrator of SBA from May 2007 to March 2009.

Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill spent the day on the television networks yesterday to discuss the U.S. economy. O'Neill said that despite swings in the stock market the economy is fundamentally strong, but it is essential for Congress to implement key items on President Bush's agenda - namely trade promotion authority, pension reform, and terrorism risk insurance - that will help ensure good jobs for Americans, promote economic growth and strengthen the economy.

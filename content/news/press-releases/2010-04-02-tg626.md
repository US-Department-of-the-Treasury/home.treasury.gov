**WASHINGTON** – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury received full repayment on its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) investment in Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. in the sum of $3.4 billion, as well as a $1 billion repayment from General Motors. TARP repayments now total $181 billion, well ahead of last fall's repayment projections for 2010.

Treasury currently estimates that its programs aimed at stabilizing the banking system will earn a profit thanks to dividends, interest, early repayments, and the sale of warrants. Total bank investments of $245 billion in FY2009 that were initially projected to cost $76 billion are now projected to bring a profit. Taxpayers have already received $14 billion through just interest and dividends and that number could be considerably higher by the end of this year.

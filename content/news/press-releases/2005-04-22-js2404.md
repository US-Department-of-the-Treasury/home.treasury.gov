Treasury is teaming up with the American Bankers Association Education Foundation next week for the ninth annual Teach Children to Save Day. More than 20 Treasury officials will join local bankers across the country on April 26 to visit primary, elementary, middle and high schools to teach students the importance of saving.

Teach Children to Save Day is an opportunity for us to highlight what teachers, parents, community leaders and so many other dedicated groups and individuals are hard at work on all year long – providing today's children with the knowledge they need to make sound financial decisions throughout their lifetimes, said Treasury Secretary John W. Snow. Knowing the facts has a way of opening doors, and when it comes to a secure economic future, we want to make sure that the doors of opportunity are wide open for America's youth.

Secretary Snow and Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral will join ABA Chairman Elizabeth A. Duke to kick off the nationwide efforts with fifth-graders from Seaton Elementary at Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing (located at 14th and C Streets, S.W. in Washington, DC) at 1:30 p.m. EDT on April 26. All attending press must call (202) 874-2778 by 3 p.m. April 25, with name, media organization, and phone number for security clearance. Media should use the 14th and C Streets S.W. (tour) entrance. Media will be asked to show press credentials.

Across the country, a total of 23 Treasury officials will be joining bankers in classrooms to teach lessons including games and activities that illustrate the value of saving, budgeting and the power of interest. For more information on National Teach Children to Save Day, please visit www.aba.com and click on Consumer Connection.

*Today, Under Secretary for International Affairs John Taylor made the following statement:*:

We welcome the progress made by the Uruguayan authorities in recent weeks and months. The government has acted swiftly to strengthen the banking system, open key sectors of the economy, and reform the tax code. Today’s decision to change the exchange rate regime is part of Uruguay’s strengthened policy strategy.

The demonstrated commitment to good policy in Uruguay has paved the way for the proposed augmentation of the IMF program, which will be presented to the executive board of the IMF next week.

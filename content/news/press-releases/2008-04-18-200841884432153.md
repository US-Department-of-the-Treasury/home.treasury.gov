Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral delivered remarks on housing Saturday at a foreclosure prevention workshop in New York. Solutions to complex housing and economic problems do not come easily, nor swiftly, but there are ways we can help people keep their homes, said Cabral during remarks to the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals last month. The HOPE NOW Alliance has been instrumental in these efforts, providing over 1.2 million loan workouts since July 2007.

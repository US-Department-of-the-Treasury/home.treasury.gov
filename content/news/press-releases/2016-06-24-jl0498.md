​**WASHINGTON**– We, G7 Ministers and Governors, respect the intention expressed today by the people of the United Kingdom to exit from the European Union. We are monitoring market developments following the outcome of the referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU.   We affirm our assessment that the UK economy and financial sector remain resilient and are confident that the UK authorities are well-positioned to address the consequences of the referendum outcome.   We recognize that excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability.   G7 central banks have taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity and to support the functioning of markets. We stand ready to use the established liquidity instruments to that end.   We will continue to consult closely on market movements and financial stability, and cooperate as appropriate.   We remain united and continue to maintain our solidarity as G7.   # # #

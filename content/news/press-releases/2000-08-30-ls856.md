FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-856

Over 27,000 firearms were reported stolen or lost from Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL) or during shipments in 1998 and 1999. We know that stolen firearms are a significant source of guns for criminals. Until now there has been no requirement for licensees to routinely inventory their guns and no one has clearly been responsible for reporting losses in shipment.

That is why I am pleased that we have issued a proposed rule to require FFLs to identify and report firearms missing from their inventory to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), as well as to report losses that occur in shipment.

The proposed rule will help strengthen enforcement of Federal firearms laws and reduce the avenues in which violent criminals and juveniles acquire illegal firearms. The proposed rule was among the recommendations accompanied by the*Commerce in Firearms Report*issued by Treasury and ATF in February 2000.

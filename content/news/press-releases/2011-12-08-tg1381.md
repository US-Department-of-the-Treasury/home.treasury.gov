The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the following statement from Secretary Tim Geithner regarding the Senate’s failure to end debate on the nomination of Richard Cordray to serve as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:   “Americans deserve the full protections signed into law under Wall Street reform. The longer the Senate fails to confirm Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the longer they will be denied that protection.”

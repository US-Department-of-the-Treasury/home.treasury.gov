The findings from an annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2003 are released today and posted on the U.S. Treasury web site at ([www.treas.gov/tic/fpis.html](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx)).

The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The previous survey was for year-end 2001, and some revisions of that survey are reported in this release. Future surveys are scheduled to be carried out annually and the next report will present results from the survey for year-end 2004.

A complementary survey measuring foreign holdings of U.S. securities is also carried out annually. Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held on June 30, 2004, are currently being processed. Preliminary results are expected to be reported by April 30, 2005.

**Overall Results**The survey measured U.S. holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2003 of approximately $3,152 billion, with $2,079 billion held in foreign equities, $874 billion in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $199 billion in foreign short-term debt securities. The previous survey, conducted as of year-end 2001, measured U.S. holdings of approximately $2,317 billion, with $1,613 billion held in foreign equities, $557 billion in foreign long-term debt securities (revised from $502 billion), and $147 billion in foreign short-term debt securities (see Table 1).

The surveys are part of an internationally coordinated effort under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to improve the measurement of portfolio asset holdings.

The stock of foreign securities for December 31, 2003 reported in this survey does not, for a number or reasons, correspond to the stock of foreign securities on December 31, 2001 plus cumulative flows reported in Treasury's transactions reporting system. An analysis of the relation between the stock and flow data is available in Table 5 and the associated text of the final report on U.S. holdings of foreign securities at end-year 2003.

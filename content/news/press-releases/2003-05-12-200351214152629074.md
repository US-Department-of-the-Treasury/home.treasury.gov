The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision today submitted draft legislative language on deposit insurance reform to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee.

The five agencies drafted the legislative language in response to a request from Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard Shelby at a February 26, 2003 Committee hearing on deposit insurance reform. Chairman Shelby requested that the five agencies work in cooperation to develop language that would best reflect the consensus presented in the agencies’ testimony.

Attached are the draft legislative language, a cover letter to Chairman Shelby, and a summary of the draft proposal.

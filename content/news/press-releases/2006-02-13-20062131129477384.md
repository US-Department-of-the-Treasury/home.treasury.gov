Treasury Secretary John Snow will travel to Capitol Hill this morning to testify on the President's FY 2007 budget proposal before the Senate Budget Committee.



In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee last week, Secretary Snow said that the proposed budget represents the President's dedication to fiscal discipline, an efficient federal government and the continuation of a thrivingU.S.economy.

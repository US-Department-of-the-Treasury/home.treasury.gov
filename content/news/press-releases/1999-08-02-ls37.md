The Treasury Department announced on Monday that its net market borrowing for the July September 1999 quarter is estimated to be a paydown of $11 billion with a cash balance of $45 billion on September 30.  The Treasury also announced that net market borrowing for the October December 1999 quarter will be approximately $65 billion with a cash balance of $80 billion on December 31.

   

In the quarterly announcement of its borrowing needs on May 3, 1999, the Treasury estimated net market borrowing for the July September quarter to be a paydown of approximately $10 billion with a cash balance of $45 billion on September 30.  Current estimates are consistent with those released in May.

   

Actual net market borrowing for the April - June 1999 quarter resulted in a paydown of $113.8 billion with an end-of-quarter cash balance of $53.1 billion.  On May 3, the Treasury estimated market borrowing for the January - March quarter to be a paydown of $116 billion with an end-of-quarter cash balance of $55 billion on June 30.  The decrease in the paydown and the cash balance are the result of a slight reduction in receipts relative to the forecast.

The regular quarterly Press Conference will be held at 9:00 AM on Wednesday, August 4, 1999.

**President-Designate Zoellick Selected as President of World Bank in Unanimous Vote**  
The World Bank's Executive Board voted unanimously this week to appoint Robert Zoellick as World Bank President. I welcome the board's action approving Bob Zoellick to lead the World Bank. Bob brings a wealth of experience, a passion for development and a proven track record of working with colleagues around the world to get results, Secretary Paulson said in a [statement](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp475).

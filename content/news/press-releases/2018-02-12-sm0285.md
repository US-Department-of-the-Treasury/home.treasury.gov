**Washington**– U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today in response to President Donald J. Trump's budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2019, and announcing the release of Treasury's Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022:

"President Trump's discretionary budget plan released today highlights Treasury's role in critical Administration policy initiatives.  Treasury provides support for the President's policies promoting economic growth, protecting the national security of the United States, and imposing fiscal discipline in Washington.  I am also pleased to share today Treasury's new Strategic Plan, which outlines our long-term goals and how we plan to achieve them over the next five years.

"The President's budget and Treasury's Strategic Plan direct resources efficiently to implement the most comprehensive tax reform legislation in more than 30 years.  They also demonstrate Treasury's commitment to combating terrorism and other illicit financing.  Treasury further supports modernizing the CFIUS review process.  The Administration aims to ensure that we protect our national security, while preserving an open investment policy to foster innovation and growth.  Finally, we are working to strengthen tax law enforcement, and strategically invest to protect information technology systems from cybersecurity threats."

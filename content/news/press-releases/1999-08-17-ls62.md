FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-62



For the past five years as Director of the U.S. Mint, Philip Diehl has proven that a government agency can match the highest performance standards of American business for customer service, financial management and Internet commerce development. Along the way, he has transformed the Mint into one of the most progressive, customer-focused enterprises in America. Under his leadership, the Mint has been recognized as a leader in the Clinton Administrations reinvention of government and the Mints labor-management partnership has received three National Partnership Awards.



Philip Diehl has permanently changed the nations coinage through the successful 50 State Quarters Program. I am pleased that he has agreed to continue as Director beyond the end of his five-year term to ensure a smooth transition as the Susan B. Anthony dollar is replaced early next year with the Sacagawea dollar coin.



I welcome the Presidents intent to nominate Jay W. Johnson as U.S. Mint Director. I am confident the Mint under Johnson leadership will continue to provide the high quality customer service for which it is distinguished.

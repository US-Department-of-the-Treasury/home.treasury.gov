As we approach the end of 2006, the American economy continues to post strong gains.  The most recent jobs report shows that our economy created 132,000 more jobs in November alone, and we've now added more than 7 million new jobs since August of 2003.  The unemployment rate has remained low, at 4.5 percent.  A recent report on retail sales shows a strong beginning to the holiday shopping season across the country – and I encourage you all to go shopping more. - President George W. Bush, 12/20/06

Today the Internal Revenue Service announced additional actions that have been taken to combat tax-evasion schemes involving credit cards issued by offshore banks. The IRS petitioned a federal court in Miami for approval to serve a John Doe summons on MasterCard for records on transactions using credit cards issued by banks in over 30 tax haven countries for 1999-2001.



We support the IRS' continuing efforts to crack down on tax avoidance transactions through the issuance of John Doe summonses that will identify US taxpayers who may be evading US taxes, stated Pamela Olson, Acting Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy. The information obtained through these summonses will provide the IRS with the ability to pursue tax cheats. Treasury and the IRS will continue to use all available resources to enforce our tax laws.

Secretary Snow is in Bismarck, ND today to meet with local business leaders and young people about the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve Social Security. In remarks to Bismarck high school students, he said, The youngest generations of Americans stand to benefit so much from this debate. President Bush is encouraging the political parties to put aside their differences for the sake of your generation... specifically, so that we can strengthen and preserve the Social Security system for your benefit.

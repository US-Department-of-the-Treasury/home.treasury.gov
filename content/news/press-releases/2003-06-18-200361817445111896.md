Treasury Secretary John Snow told a group of Wall Street economists, money managers and business leaders in New York this week that President Bush's recently enacted plan for jobs and growth will help strengthen the economy and that he is, confident that the plan is going to have a serious impact on overall economic growth and job creation in the United States this year.

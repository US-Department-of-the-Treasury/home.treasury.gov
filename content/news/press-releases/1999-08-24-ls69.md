The Administration respects the independence of the Federal Reserve in making decisions about our nations monetary policy. We share the Federal Reserves goals of maintaining healthy economic growth while preserving low inflation.

Supported by sound economic policies, the economy continues to grow, with strong investments and higher productivity, creating good jobs and improved living standards for all Americans. We are committed to continued budget discipline which will be an important part of sustaining this economic success into the future.

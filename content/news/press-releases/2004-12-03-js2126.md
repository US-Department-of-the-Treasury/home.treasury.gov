The government of Pakistan formally announced to the Executive Board of the IMF, its decision to forego the final tranche of its approximate $1.5 billion Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program. We congratulate the Pakistan government for its stewardship of the economy which has created an impressive turnaround since Pakistan entered the PRGF arrangement three years ago. Not only has Pakistan successfully completed its second consecutive IMF program, but it also has returned to international capital markets, and just last week received a credit rating upgrade. Foregoing the final tranche highlights Pakistan's increased economic strength and the confidence of its economic officials.

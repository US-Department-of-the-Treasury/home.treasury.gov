Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Eric Solomon participated in a panel discussion on tax reform today. In December the Department of the Treasury released a study on various approaches to improving the competitiveness of the U.S. business tax system. The world economy has changed dramatically over the past half century and so too has the U.S. role in that economy. Trade and investment flow with greater volume and greater ease. As we look to the future, many factors, including education, immigration, and trade policies play an important role in the lives and living standards of U.S. workers and in the ability of U.S. companies to compete globally, said Solomon.

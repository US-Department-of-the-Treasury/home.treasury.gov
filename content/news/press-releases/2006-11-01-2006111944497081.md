The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated seven individuals and ten entities associated with notorious North Valle drug cartel leader Carlos Alberto Renteria Mantilla, aka Beto Renteria.  "Beto Renteria is one of Colombia's most powerful and sophisticated narcotics traffickers, investing his illicit proceeds across businesses in Colombia and offshore locations," said Adam Szubin, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.  "Today we have again taken aim at Beto Renteria's organization, exposing his web of front companies and targeting their assets."

Secretary John W. Snow this week hailed the two year anniversary of the Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI), which was established on April 28, 2004. TFI has played an important role in helping to protect the economic and national security of the United States by harnessing its financial information, expertise, and economic authorities and influence to attack the financial underpinnings of terrorists, narcotics traffickers, weapons proliferators and rogue regimes.

BRISBANE - The economic consequences of climate change are far-reaching.  The Green Climate Fund will leverage private and public finance to reduce carbon pollution and strengthen climate resilience in developing countries, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable. The Fund will promote opportunities for U.S. entrepreneurs and manufacturers who are creating the clean energy technologies of the future.

 

Efforts to address climate change through public-private partnerships have been the cornerstone of a bipartisan agenda in the United States for many years. President Obama's announcement today marks another significant step by the United States to lead efforts to help countries reduce climate pollution and increase climate resiliency.

Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. delivered remarks today to the Exchequer Club of Washington. He spoke on the markets and the economy. Clearly, the bipartisan stimulus plan enacted early this year has supported the U.S. economy during this difficult period, and couldn't have been timelier. American families spent; companies invested and benefited from strong export growth, said Paulson.

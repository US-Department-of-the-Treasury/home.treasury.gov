The Treasury Department announced on Tuesday the regular schedule for issues of inflation-indexed securities. As it has since it initiated indexed securities auctions in January 1997, the Treasury will auction inflation-indexed securities in January, April, July, and October. In January and July, the Treasury will auction 10-year indexed notes, and in April and October it will auction 30-year indexed bonds. The Treasury may continue to issue (i.e., reopen) additional amounts of an outstanding indexed security in one of these regular auctions. The Treasury will discontinue issuing 5-year indexed notes.

This announcement is consistent with the recommendations of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee and of other investors and dealers with whom Treasury officials have spoken.

Including the reopening of the 3-5/8% 10-year inflation-indexed note of January 15, 2008 announced today, the Treasury will have issued $63 billion of indexed securities to the public since January 1997.

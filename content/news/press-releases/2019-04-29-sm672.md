WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing[1] for April – June 2019 and July – September 2019 quarters:

During the April – June 2019 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $30 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $270 billion.  The borrowing estimate is $53 billion lower than announced in January 2019.  The decrease in borrowing is driven by changes to projections of fiscal activity and cash balance assumptions.[2]

During the July – September 2019 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $160 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $85 billion.

During the January – March 2019 quarter, Treasury borrowed $374 billion in privately-held net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $334 billion.  In January 2019, Treasury estimated privately-held net marketable borrowing of $365 billion and assumed an end-of-March cash balance of $320 billion.2 The change in borrowing resulted from the higher end-of-quarter cash balance partially offset by higher net cash flows.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 1, 2019.

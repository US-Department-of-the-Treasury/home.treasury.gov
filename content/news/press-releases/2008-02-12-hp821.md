The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today designated Medellin-based narcotics trafficker Carlos Mario Jimenez Naranjo (a.k.a. Macaco) as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker pursuant to Executive Order 12978.OFAC also targeted seven companies and seven individuals that comprise Jimenez Naranjo's financial network.



Jimenez Naranjo is among the most dangerous Colombian narcotics traffickers today,said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin.Today's designation serves notice to Macaco and his associates that the United States is committed to disrupting their network of illicitly-obtained assets in Medellin and elsewhere.



Carlos Mario Jimenez Naranjo has been indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2005 and in the Southern District of Florida in 2007.He is in Colombian custody awaiting extradition to the United States.OFAC sanctions investigators worked closely with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on this investigation and also received key support from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).



Among the individuals designated today were Rosa Edelmira Luna Cordoba, the wife of Carlos Mario Jimenez Naranjo, and Marco Julio Londono Vasquez.Luna Cordoba and Londono Vasquez act as front persons through their roles as owners and managers for companies that are owned or controlled by Jimenez Naranjo.Luna Cordoba and Londono Vasquez were also indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the Southern District of Florida in 2007 along with Jimenez Naranjo.



The seven companies designated today are located in or around Medellin, Colombia.Among these companies are:*Inversiones Licom Ltda.*, which does business as*Restaurante Angus Brangus*in Medellin;*Tejar la Mojosa S.A.*, a ceramic products company that operates in the Colombian state of Antioquia; and the cattle companies*Administradora Ganadera el 45 Ltda.*and*Ganaderia Luna Hermanos Ltda.*, both located in Medellin.



This designation is part of the ongoing interagency effort by the Departments of the Treasury, Justice, State and Homeland Security to implement Executive Order 12978 of October 21, 1995, which applies financial sanctions against Colombia's drug cartels.  Today's designation action freezes any assets the designees may have that are subject to U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits all financial and commercial transactions by any U.S. person with the designated companies and individuals.



A detailed look at the program against Colombian drug organizations is provided in OFAC's March 2007*Impact Report on Economic Sanctions Against Colombian Drug Cartels. *

Brian Roseboro has shown outstanding leadership within Treasury and the Administration for over three years. He served the President with distinction both as the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Markets and, most recently, as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance.



In his role, Mr. Roseboro advised me on all aspects of domestic finance and his counsel was always valued. His experience and insight will be missed, and I wish him the best in his future endeavors. I deeply appreciate the wisdom and dedication that he brought to his work here; his country was fortunate to benefit from his efforts as a public servant.

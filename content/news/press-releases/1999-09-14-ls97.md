The papers released today by the Financial Services Roundtable - papers authored by academic and policy experts - support the argument that banks should have a choice of operating through subsidiaries or affiliates. The work of these economists confirm the conclusion that the Treasury Department, the FDIC, and other independent analysts reached sometime ago: a financial modernization bill should allow banking organizations to choose the structure that best serves their customers without adversely affecting competition or safety and soundness.

Departments and the Bureau commit to working together to strengthen servicing protections

The Departments of Treasury and Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) are announcing a Joint Statement of Principles on Student Loan Servicing. This work by the Departments of Education and Treasury builds on the Obama Administration’s ongoing efforts to help Americans manage their student loan debt.

Last March, as part of the Student Aid Bill of Rights, President Obama directed several federal agencies to improve student loan servicing and help make paying for higher education an easier and fairer experience for millions of Americans, regardless of the type of loan they have. These federal agencies were directed to consult with the CFPB, an independent federal regulator.

The document issued today serves as a guiding statement to improve student loan servicing practices, promote borrower success, and minimize defaults as the federal agencies and the CFPB continue to work to protect student loan borrowers and to ensure consumers receive high quality student loan servicing.

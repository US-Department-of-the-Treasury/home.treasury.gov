Secretary Snow today testified before the Senate Banking Committee on the Treasury's Report to Congress on International Economic and Exchange Rate Policies. In September of 2003, we began an intensive engagement with China, aimed at hastening China's move to a more flexible exchange rate. As a result of our approach, of constant intense engagement, China is now ready to introduce flexibility and should do so now.

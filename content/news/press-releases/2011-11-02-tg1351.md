**WASHINGTON** – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced the appointment of 15 individuals to serve as members of the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance (the “Committee”). The Committee will provide advice to Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”), which was established as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, on issues related to the responsibilities of the office.     “These individuals have tremendous knowledge about the insurance industry and a wide cross-section of experience,” said Michael McRaith, Director of the FIO. “I’m pleased that they will be offering their valuable expertise as the Federal Insurance Office continues moving forward with its critical work.”   The FIO monitors all aspects of the insurance industry, including identifying issues that could contribute to systemic risk in the insurance industry or the U.S. financial system.  It also assesses the availability and affordability of insurance to traditionally underserved populations; advises the Secretary of the Treasury on major domestic insurance policy issues; and develops and coordinates federal policy on international insurance regulatory matters.   Recognizing that states are the regulators of the U.S. insurance system, nearly half of the Committee is comprised of state insurance regulators.  The remaining members of the Committee will bring a diverse set of perspectives on the insurance industry, with backgrounds ranging from consumer advocacy and academia to the business of insurance lines.   The 15 individuals appointed today to the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance include: 
- David Birnbaum, Economist and Executive Director, Center for Economic Justice
- Michael Consedine, Commissioner, Commonwealth of the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance
- Jacqueline Cunningham, Commissioner, State of Virginia Bureau of Insurance

The New Markets Tax Credit is another important step in this Administration's commitment to promote growth in distressed areas by opening markets and investing in people that has proved so successful for our economy as a whole.

The legislation introduced by Representative Rangel and Senators Rockefeller and Robb will help attract $6 billion in private sector capital for investment in businesses in distressed communities. The tax credit will help create new jobs, stimulate small business growth and strengthen communities across the United States.

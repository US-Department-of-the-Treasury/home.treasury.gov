FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-525

B. John Williams worked tirelessly in leading the Office of the Chief Counsel to crack down on abusive tax shelters, to improve the process for developing regulations and rulings, and to work with taxpayers in resolving issues. He did an excellent job, and taxpayers were extremely well served during his tenure as IRS Chief Counsel. I look forward to ensuring that B. John's legacy of excellence as well as his improvements in the Office of Chief Counsel are carried on.

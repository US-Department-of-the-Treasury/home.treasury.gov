Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Pam Olson, IRS Commissioner Mark W. Everson, and IRS Chief Counsel B. John Williams will hold a briefing on Thursday, June 19, 2003 at 4:30 pm in room 3108 (Tax Policy conference room). This session will provide a briefing on a John Doe summons that is being served to Jenkens & Gilchrist, asking the law firm to identify taxpayers who may have invested in listed transactions or other potentially abusive transactions organized or sold by the firm's Chicago office. This will also allow for a Question and Answer session with Tax Policy staff. No cameras will be admitted-- this is a “pen and pad” only briefing.

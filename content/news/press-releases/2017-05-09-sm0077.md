**WASHINGTON** —The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) held its third annual Law Enforcement Awards ceremony today at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  FinCEN presented awards to law enforcement agencies that use Bank Secrecy Act reporting provided by financial institutions in their criminal investigations.  The goals of the program are to recognize law enforcement agencies that made effective use of financial institution reporting to obtain a successful prosecution, and to demonstrate to the financial industry the value of its reporting to law enforcement.  The program emphasizes that prompt and accurate reporting by the financial industry is vital to the successful partnership with law enforcement to fight financial crime.

"The scope and quality of the data that we are collecting through Bank Secrecy Act reporting is constantly improving, and FinCEN has made great advancements to provide law enforcement and stakeholders faster and easier access to financial intelligence that will assist with investigations and prosecutions," said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin, who congratulated award recipients at the opening of the awards ceremony.  "These success stories highlight the value of our ongoing efforts to strengthen partnerships to combat money laundering, fraud, corruption, criminal trafficking, and other illicit activities."

The program includes six award categories recognizing achievements in combatting significant threats to the integrity of the financial system and the safety of our communities.  The program is open to all Federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.  View the full press release and the 2017 award recipients on the FinCEN website:

Mark Weinberger, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, made the following statement on the passage of the Internet tax moratorium bill:



We are very pleased that Congress has passed a bill that extends the Internet tax moratorium. The government should be promoting Internet usage and availability, not discouraging it with access taxes or discriminatory taxes. This two-year extension will provide additional time to analyze the impact of e-commerce on local and State tax receipts, while ensuring that the growth of the Internet is not slowed by new taxes.

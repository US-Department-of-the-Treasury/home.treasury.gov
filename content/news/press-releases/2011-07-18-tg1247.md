**WASHINGTON** – As the first anniversary of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act approaches, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) convened its seventh meeting today at the U.S. Department of the Treasury and approved the following documents and resolutions put forward during today’s session: a final rule on the Council’s authority to designate financial market utilities as systemically important; a secured creditor haircut study pursuant to section 215 of the Dodd-Frank Act; and the minutes of the May 24, 2011 and July 13, 2011 Council meetings. At today’s meeting, members also discussed the Council’s 2011 Annual Report, which will be finalized and released in the coming days.** Final Rule on Authority to Designate Financial Market Utilities as Systemically Important ** Section 804 of the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Council the authority to designate as systemically important a financial market utility (FMU) if the Council determines that its failure or a disruption to its operations could create or increase the risk of significant liquidity or credit problems spreading among financial institutions or markets and thereby threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system.  An FMU designated by the Council as systemically important would become subject to the requirements of Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act, including risk management standards and additional examinations.
 
An advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on FMU designations was approved for public comment at the Council’s November 2010 meeting. Additionally, the Council approved a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) on FMU designations for public comment at its March 2011 meeting.
 
*The final rule on FMU designations, as passed by the Council, is available at www.treasury.gov/FSOC.*
 
**Secured Creditor Haircut Study ** Section 215 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires Council to conduct a study evaluating the importance of maximizing United States taxpayer protections and promoting market discipline with respect to the treatment of fully secured creditors in the utilization of the orderly liquidation authority authorized by the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
*The study, as passed by the Council, will be available at www.treasury.gov/FSOC. *
 
**Minutes from the Council’s May 24, 2011 and July 13, 2011 Meeting**

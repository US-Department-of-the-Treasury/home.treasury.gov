Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Mark Warshawsky participatedyesterdayin a panel discussion on the Administration's pension reform agenda before the DC Bar's March meeting. We are pleased that both the House and the Senate have taken action on this important problem by passing pension reform legislation, and we remain committed to working with Congress as they proceed to conference, Warshawsky said. Nevertheless, the Administration is concerned that the reforms currently being considered by Congress are inadequate and that stronger action is needed to improve the protection of pension benefits, to ensure the integrity of the pension insurance system, and to avert a taxpayer bailout. In the absence of changes to strengthen the legislation, workers will face an increased risk of losing pension benefits promised to them by their employers.

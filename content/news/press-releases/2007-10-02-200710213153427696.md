Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. announced the members of the Treasury Advisory Committee on the Auditing Profession today. The public committee,[which Secretary Paulson first announced in May](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp408), will make recommendations to encourage a more sustainable auditing profession. Investor trust in the integrity of our capital markets is vital to the strength of the U.S. economy. Investor trust is based on accurate financial reporting, and a vibrant auditing profession is essential for a well-functioning financial reporting system, said Secretary Paulson.

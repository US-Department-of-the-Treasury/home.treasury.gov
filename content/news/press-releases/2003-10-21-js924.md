Director Sloan has brought strong leadership to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. FinCENs unique position as a Treasury regulatory agency, as well as a law enforcement support network, enables it to serve as a bridge between the financial and law enforcement communities.

Under Jims leadership, FinCENs support to investigators tracking terrorist financing and its regulatory work implementing important anti-terror legislation such as the USA PATRIOT Act, have played a key role in the war on terrorism.  Jim departs with the sincere gratitude and best wishes of all of us here at Treasury.

**Note: James F. Sloan has served as Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) since April 1999 and has accepted a new position as the Assistant Commandant for Intelligence at the United States Coast Guard beginning November 17.** James F.

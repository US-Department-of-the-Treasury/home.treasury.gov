As a follow up to the Nov. 18 Small Business Financing Forum, Treasury and the Small Business Administration issued a Report to the President summarizing the policy ideas and recommendations discussed. This forum brought together small business owners, lenders, regulators and policymakers for an open discussion focused on the best ideas for providing the support small businesses need to continue to drive economic recovery. This report is aimed at continuing this important dialogue going forward, including at the President's Forum on Jobs and Economic Growth tomorrow, at which Secretary Geithner and Administrator Mills will be leading a session on Paving the Road for Small Business Job Growth.

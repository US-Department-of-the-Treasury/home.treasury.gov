Increasing consumer confidence levels are an encouraging sign as the economy continues to gain strength. Following a ten-point jump in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index earlier this month, January's Consumer Confidence Index reached its highest point in 18 months.



The positive mood reflects the success of the President's economic policies as well as encouraging news in many areas of the economy such as housing, manufacturing and business investment. Despite the increasing signs of good news, there is more work to be done. This Administration will continue in its efforts to create a stronger environment for job creation and will not be satisfied until every American looking for work can find it.

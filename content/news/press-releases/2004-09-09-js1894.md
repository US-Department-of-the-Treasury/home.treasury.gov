FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-1894

 

Jerry Hawke served honorably and well as the Comptroller of the Currency for nearly six years, and before that for three and half years as the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance. As Comptroller, Jerry played a critical role in leading Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the chartering, regulation and supervision of national banks. His work helped ensure that this country maintains a safe, sound and competitive banking system that supports the citizens, communities, and economy of the United States.

During his tenure as Comptroller, Jerry supervised 2,000 federally chartered commercial banks and about 51 federal branches and agencies of foreign banks in the United States, comprising more than half of the assets of the commercial banking system. A dedicated public servant, Jerry has made innumerable valued contributions to the Treasury Department over the years and his colleagues and I wish him the best in his future endeavors. He departs with the sincere appreciation and well wishes of all of us here at Treasury.

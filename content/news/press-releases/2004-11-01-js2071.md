The Treasury Department announced today that it expects net borrowing of marketable debt to total $100 billion in the October December 2004 quarter.  The estimated cash balance on December 31 is $25 billion.  In the last quarterly announcement on August 2, 2004, Treasury announced that it expected net borrowing to total $122 billion with an estimated end-of-quarter cash balance of $35 billion.  Lower borrowing estimates are primarily due to lower outlays and a change in cash balance assumptions.

Treasury also announced that it expects net borrowing of marketable debt to total $147 billion in the January March 2005 quarter.  The estimated cash balance on March 31 is $10 billion.

During the July September 2004 quarter, Treasury's net marketable borrowing totaled $89 billion and the cash balance on September 30 was $36 billion.  On August 2, Treasury announced that it expected net marketable borrowing to total $89 billion with an estimated end-of-quarter cash balance of $35 billion.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury's Quarterly Refunding will be released at 9:00 A.M. on Wednesday, November 3.

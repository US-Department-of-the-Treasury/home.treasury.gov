Moscow, RUSSIA - Juan Zarate, the Treasury Department's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, made the following statement upon the conclusion of meetings with officials from the Russian Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs:

The U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Russian Finance Ministry today set out an ambitious agenda to partner in the international fight against terrorist financing and money laundering. This partnership is an important element in the overall counter-terrorism cooperation between the United States and the Russian Federation, and this meeting provided the foundation for a report to President George Bush and President Vladimir Putin on specific joint action being undertaken by both Departments. The strengthening of this partnership is both vital and timely, as it parallels current efforts by both the Treasury and Finance Ministry to bolster and expand capabilities, allowing us to more effectively combat terrorist financing.

Among the specific items of discussion was the agreement by both Departments to work together in identifying foreign banks that are involved in terrorist financing, money laundering and other illicit activities. Treasury and the Finance Ministry also discussed an initiative to ensure that the countries of Central Asia have the necessary capacities to fight the financial war on terror.

The United States and the Russian Federation have forged a strong relationship, and the cooperation and resolution between the Treasury and Finance Ministry enhances this partnership. We look forward to reaping the benefits of this cooperation as we continue to battle the ever-evolving face of terrorism throughout the globe.

**WASHINGTON** — The U.S. Department of the Treasury and IRS announced today that they are working directly with the[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs](http://www.va.gov/)(VA) to ensure Veterans and their beneficiaries who receive Compensation and Pension (C&P) benefit payments will receive their[Economic Impact Payments](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center)automatically and without additional paperwork.

“Economic Impact Payments will be issued automatically to our Veterans and their families who did not file tax returns for 2018 or 2019,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “The Treasury, IRS and VA are working hard to ensure our nation’s heroes receive these payments quickly and without any additional action or paperwork.”

Many non-tax filing beneficiaries have already begun using the[“Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info”](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here)tool to provide basic personal information to receive their EIP. There will be no interruption to payments being processed using this online tool. Veterans with Internet access are encouraged to continue providing information.

For those who do not have access, or choose not to use the[“Non-Filers: Enter Payment Info”](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/non-filers-enter-payment-info-here)tool, their EIP will be processed with no further action required from them.

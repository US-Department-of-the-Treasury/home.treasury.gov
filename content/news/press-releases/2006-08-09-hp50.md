HP-50

I was saddened this week to learn of the passing of John Weinberg.  John was a trusted friend and mentor and my thoughts and prayers are with his family.

I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with and learn from John throughout my career.  He was an innovative and dedicated leader who provided over fifty years of service to Goldman Sachs.

Most importantly, John preserved the firm's integrity and values set in place by his father, Sidney Weinberg, Goldman's chairman from 1930-1969.  He will also be remembered for his devotion to service – to his colleagues, to his community, and to his country.

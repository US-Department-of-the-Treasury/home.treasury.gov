FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-422

I applaud the Leaders and Members of Congress who voted to preserve the full faith and credit of the U.S. government by increasing the statutory debt ceiling. They put politics aside and took action to ensure that the government's payment obligations to the military, retirees and Medicare recipients will be met on time. Today's action prevents uncertainty that would adversely impact our economic recovery. I commend Congress for its action.

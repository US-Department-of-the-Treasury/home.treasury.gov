Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. participated in a Foreign Affairs Magazine conference call Tuesday on China. The Secretary recently wrote an article for the magazine on how engaging China on shared economic interests brings economic and non-economic benefits to both our nations. The United States and China -- and, indeed, the international community -- share a powerful interest in China's successful integration into the global economic system. The prosperity of both nations depends on the ability of each to achieve balanced economic growth, on stable and vibrant trade and financial regimes, on diverse and dependable energy sources, and on sustainable progress that protects human health and the environment, said Paulson.

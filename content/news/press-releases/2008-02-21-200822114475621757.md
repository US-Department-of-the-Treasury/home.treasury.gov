The Department of the Treasury designated Rami Makhluf, a powerful Syrian businessman and regime insider, today for improperly benefiting from public corruption of Syrian regime officials. Syria is well known for its corrupt business environment, which denies the Syrian people economic prosperity and other freedoms. Rami Makhluf has used intimidation and his close ties to the Asad regime to obtain improper business advantages at the expense of ordinary Syrians, said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey.

Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson spoke at luncheon hosted by the Economic Club of New York this week on the competitiveness of the U.S. capital markets. We must remember that the competitiveness of our capital markets depends to a large extent on our nation's overall economic competitiveness. We are fortunate that because our economy is so strong, we approach our challenges from a position of strength. And we should use this position of strength to tackle long-term challenges that will affect our economic competitiveness.

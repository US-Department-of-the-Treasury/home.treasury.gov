John B. Taylor Under Secretary of  Treasury for International Affairs Roundtable Meeting with Haitian Community Leadership Organized by the Florida Association for Volunteer Action in the Caribbean and the Americas Jean-JacquesDessalineCommunity CenterMiami, Florida  - August 23, 2004

I would like to begin by thanking Julieta Valls and Rebecca Reichert of the Florida Association for Volunteer Action in the Caribbean and the Americas (FAVACA) for coordinating this event, as well as Jorge Arrizurieta and Nicole de Lara of Florida FTAA, Inc., for their assistance in making today's meeting happen.I am pleased to be here today and see the continued strong interest and commitment to Haiti.

 

I would like to take this opportunity to discuss the Bush Administration's efforts to work with the international community to support economic reconstruction in Haiti.I will argue that there are two essential ingredients to this effort: measuring results and encouraging the private sector and the Haitian Diaspora to play a significant role.

**The Role of the Bush Administration and International Community**When the new Haitian government took office earlier this year, it faced an enormous array of challenges.I am pleased to say that in the area I know best--the economic sphere--the new authorities have shown their commitment to address these challenges.Although they immediately confronted a severe fiscal crisis, with few government funds to meet increasing needs for government services, they refrained from the all too familiar route of printing money and sparking uncontrolled inflation.Instead, they moved swiftly to restore the government's revenue base, collect unpaid back taxes, and restrain spending to levels that could be covered by incoming revenues.At the same time, the new government took actions to restore basic services such as electrical power generation, supported by expeditious assistance from the United States.

The United States and its partners in the international community have responded quickly to assist the Haitian government in addressing Haiti's urgent needs and begin to lay the basis for economic growth.Experts from 26 governments and multilateral institutions traveled to Haiti this spring to work with the government in creating a plan to rebuild Haiti's infrastructure, strengthen institutions, and improve basic services.This international effort culminated in a two-year plan--known as the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF)--which outlines the government's strategy to tackle the priority needs identified through this process.This plan also serves as a framework for donors to find a way a help.

On July 20, the international community came together to pledge over $1 billion in assistance to meet the needs identified in the ICF over the next two years.The United States committed to provide $230 million.This is on top of the more than $850 million in aid the U.S. has provided since 1995.The Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund--all institutions with which Treasury works closely--were also critical to making the donors conference a success.

This was a successful first step.Now the important work begins to build the roads, schools, health clinics, and other institutions this assistance is intended to produce.We cannot forget that in the mid-1990s, there was a similar donor effort with large pledges of international assistance.However, that assistance failed to improve the living standards of the Haitian people.We need to learn from the mistakes of the past and ensure that things are different this time around.

Part of that means applying a theme that President Bush has emphasized since the opening days of his administration:measurable results.Too often foreign assistance efforts lack clearly specified goals, objectives, and timelines.As a result, the efforts of various donors are poorly coordinated, focus is lost, and progress stalls.Over time donor attention shifts elsewhere, leaving too little of lasting value accomplished.

For this reason, the United States has put strong emphasis on measurable results in the context of the international community's engagement with Haiti.The ICF contains a good outline of goals and timelines.The next step is to operationalize concrete goals and timelines for donors' work in individual sectors, whether that means roadbuilding, police training, expansion of health services, or any other area.Later this week, donors will meet in Port-au-Prince to take the next steps to review the assistance they are providing and further develop the framework for coordinating their efforts and monitoring progress.It is important that we evaluate progress regularly to guarantee donors as well as the government are taking the necessary steps to quickly implement projects.

I would like to say a few words about the special role that the Treasury Department has to play in supporting economic growth in Haiti.Treasury's Office of Technical Assistance works with countries throughout the world to provide expert training on budgetary procedures, tax administration, financial institutions and financial crimes.Treasury has sent three technical assistance teams to Haiti over the past four months to identify steps that can be taken to strengthen tax administration, budget management, and financial crimes.Treasury currently has a team in Port-au-Prince working with the Haitian Central Bank to strengthen financial crimes law enforcement.

Our Technical Assistance program reflects the importance we attach to technical training, consultation, and international collaboration to build local capacity, which is crucial in creating an environment for dynamic growth.I understand that Florida Association for Volunteer Action in the Caribbean and the Americas (FAVACA) also shares this mission and look forward to hearing more from their representatives here today.

**The Role of the Private Sector**In that spirit, let me now move on to the role of the private sector in laying the basis for a better future in Haiti.Official aid alone cannot create the jobs and sustainable economic growth that is so desperately needed to raise living standards and lift more Haitians out of poverty.A vibrant private sector--particularly the growth of small businesses--is central to these goals.Developing that vibrant private sector requires the right economic policies by the government--policies that promote private investment and encourage entrepreneurs--as well as the technological and business expertise of businesspeople inside and outside of Haiti.

Based on what I have seen to date, I think that the Haitian government understands the importance of sound economic policies to encourage the private sector.Last month, I had the opportunity to visit Haiti and meet with the Prime Minister, various government officials, and business community leaders.We talked at length about the role of the private sector in Haiti's future and the role that the government plays in creating a regulatory and economic environment which businesses can thrive.

The government has demonstrated its intentions through its actions.I already mentioned the fiscal and monetary restraint displayed by the new authorities upon coming to office.With the assistance of the IMF, the government has defined a strategy for containing inflation, maintaining fiscal responsibility, increasing transparency, and improving governance.The government showed leadership in the crafting of the ICF and in its commitment to put forward $127 million meet critical needs, including roads, improving electrical distribution, strengthening institutional capacity and increasing security as part of that development plan.

Government officials have also opened the door to the private sector and have begun real dialogue.Last month, Haitian Ministers participated in a private sector event on the margins of the donors conference where they highlighted the important role of the private sector in their growth strategy and outlined their plans to introduce business-friendly initiatives, such as one-stop shops and free trade zones.

To be sure, there is a long way to go.An estimated 95% of private employment is in the informal sector.There are numerous obstacles to business creation and expansion to overcome.But I believe the Haitian authorities want to take the actions needed to create an enabling environment for growth.The private sector has an important role to play in helping the government identify those actions.

In addition to sharing views on the needs of the private sector with the government, the Haitian Diaspora also has an important role as a source of financing and technological know-how.An estimated $1 billion in remittances flowed to Haiti in 2003, roughly equal to 30% of GDP.In addition to meeting basic needs, these funds have the potential to be used to help start new businesses or allow families to keep their children in school.I would encourage you in the Diaspora and in the business community to continue to look forward innovative ways in which remittance flows can be channeled into productive investments that provide for higher standards of living in the future.

I should note that in recognition of the importance of remittance flows, the Bush Administration has launched a global effort to reduce the cost of sending remittances and increase the availability of remittance services.At the Summit of the Americas held in Monterrey, Mexico, earlier this year, President Bush secured agreement among the Hemisphere's leaders to implement the steps needed to cut the average cost of sending remittances in the region in half by 2008.Haiti is in a position to benefit enormously from this initiative.Despite the large volume of flows to Haiti, the cost of sending remittances to Haiti remains high--the IDB estimated the average cost at 8.8% of the amount transferred, which is among the higher costs in the region.

Financial support alone is not enough to build viable businesses.The Haitian private sector needs to cultivate the technical skills for expanding and creating jobs.The technological and business expertise of many of you in this audience--and others like you--is a vital ingredient in this process.It is evident that the Haitian Diaspora also has a wealth of expertise that can be shared.I know that you will continue to build bridges with the Haitian business community to develop new business ventures that transform Haiti's potential into reality.

One area of opportunity is the export sector.Haiti's exports began to pick up in 2003, increasing by 21%, after a three-year decline.However, the value of imports in Haiti was about three and a half times larger than exports in 2003, and Haitian exporting activity remains low when compared to its neighbors.Exports from Haiti are about 1/20th of that of its neighbor, the Dominican Republic.Pursuing new markets opportunities and developing strategies to capitalize on Haiti's comparative advantages--namely its proximity to large markets like the UnitedState and lower labor and operational costs--are essential steps to building up the export sector.

**Conclusion**The Bush Administration will continue to work with the Haitian government, other bilateral donors, and the international financial institutions to lay the foundation for higher economic growth and poverty reduction in Haiti.I hope that each of you will also continue your commitment to Haiti and work with the Haitian community to set timelines, measure results, and encourage the vibrant private sector that is critical for Haiti's future success.

Thank you again for your participation in this event, and I would welcome your thoughts, ideas, and questions.

Secretary John W. Snow discussed the economy and job creation during an interview with PBS' Nightly Business Report on Thursday, saying the fundamentals of this economy are so strong. We`ve got GDP growth moving along at a really good, good clip. You know, the last six months of the year of `03, we had the highest growth rate in 25 years. Capital spending is coming back. Mortgage rates are low. The housing market is strong. Construction is strong. Exports are picking up. Manufacturing is coming back. And business confidence is coming back. So, yes, I think the fundamentals are in place for a good recovery, with a nice pickup in jobs.

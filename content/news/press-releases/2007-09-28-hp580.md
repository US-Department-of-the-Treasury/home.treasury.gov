HP-580

The Senate's swift action on the debt limit today helps to protect the full faith and credit of the United States and avoids creating unnecessary uncertainty in the U.S. Treasuries market. I commend Congress for passing legislation that ensures the U.S. government can deliver on promises already made, such as Social Security and Medicare payments.

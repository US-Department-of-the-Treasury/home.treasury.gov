*(Archived Content)*As Ramadan begins, the U.S. Department of the Treasury recognizes the particular importance of charitable giving throughout the holy month of Ramadan for Muslims in America and around the world.  Charitable giving is a fundamental characteristic of many faiths, and*zakat*, one of the five pillars of Islam, is a sacred obligation for Muslims.

Treasury underscores its support for the important work of the charitable sector in providing essential services to those in need, both at home and abroad.  Treasury remains committed to strengthening its engagement with the donor community and the charitable sector to support their efforts while at the same time, safeguarding charities from abuse by terrorist organizations.‪‪ In recent years, the charitable sector has taken significant steps to promote transparency and to guard against such abuse.

We look forward to strengthening our partnership with the charitable sector and the donor community to further advance our shared objective of protecting legitimate charitable activity.

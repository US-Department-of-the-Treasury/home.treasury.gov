Today, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill reiterated President Bush's steadfast support for elimination of the death tax.

The President made a compelling case for eliminating the unfair death tax. Government has no business confiscating the legacy parents work their entire lives to build for their children, said O'Neill.

Secretary O'Neill looks forward to the House Ways and Means Committee mark-up of death tax repeal tomorrow.

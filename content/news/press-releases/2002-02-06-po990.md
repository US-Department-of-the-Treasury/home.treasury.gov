I'm disappointed the Senate Democratic leadership couldn't produce a bill to help create jobs and put Americans back to work. Passing an extension of unemployment benefits is the least they can do. It's just as important that we create new jobs. By failing to produce a bill to stimulate the economy, the Senate Democratic leadership has failed to help Americans get back to work as quickly as possible.

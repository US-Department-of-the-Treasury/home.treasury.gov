Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families inLondon today.

I have spoken to my friend and colleague,UK Chancellor of the Treasury Gordon Brown, and expressed these thoughts to him, and offered our help and assistance as they deal with this tragic situation.

At the Treasury Department we are monitoring global markets.  I will stay in touch with world financial leaders.

As the President remarked this morning, these horrific acts stand in stark contrast to the compassionate work that is being done at the G8 summit inGleneagles, Scotland. He noted how vivid the distinction, that while world leaders work together to alleviate poverty, save lives by fighting the pandemic of AIDS and improve the environment for all the world's people, others are bent on killing and destruction.

Like our allies inBritain, the strength of our country can be found in our people, our beliefs in justice and the rule of law. And while there are brutal killers who hate us for these humanitarian beliefs, the truth that freedom works is irrefutable. Our resolve for freedom around the globe is unwavering.

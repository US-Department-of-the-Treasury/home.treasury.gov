During the first day of the fifth Cabinet-level meeting of the Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED), 15 U.S. Cabinet officials and agency heads joined Secretary Paulson for discussions with China's Vice Premier Wang Qishan and a delegation of 21 Chinese ministers and agency heads. Following a robust and productive discussion on strengthening cooperation in energy and the environment, the officials signed an EcoPartnerships Framework, which resulted from the June commitment to explore EcoPartnerships as a means of concrete cooperation between our two nations.

The dialogue in Beijing builds upon the progress that has been made in previous meetings of the SED to promote energy security and further environmental sustainability. Specific energy and the environment steps previously agreed to by both countries include a Ten Year Framework on Energy and Environment Cooperation, an agreement to establish a national emissions trading program in China, and an agreement to strengthen cooperation on strategic oil stocks with the International Energy Agency.

**EcoPartnerships** Today, the United States and China signed an EcoPartnership Framework that describes the scope and establishes objectives for EcoPartnerships. Targeted at the sub-national level, EcoPartnerships are voluntary, cooperative efforts between U.S. and Chinese entities. They include local, state or provincial government-to-government partnerships, and partnerships among businesses, universities and non-profits, where ideas can be tested in targeted areas before broad introduction. Through voluntary cooperative partnerships, EcoPartnerships will demonstrate new models for sustainable economic growth and advance energy security, economic sustainability and environmental sustainability.** The US and China welcomed the creation of seven EcoPartnerships:**

Each of these EcoPartnerships will last a minimum of two years, and will report progress on their initiatives at future meetings of the SED. Additional information about EcoPartnerships can be found online at[www.EcoPartnerships.gov](http://www.ecopartnership.gov/)beginning on Friday, December 5.

**The U.S. – China Ten Year Energy and Environment Cooperation Framework** Building upon the signing of the Ten Year Framework at the fourth Cabinet-level SED meeting in June 2008, the United States and China today announced consensus on action plans for each of the five goals under the Framework: 1. Clean, Efficient and Secure Electricity Production and Transmission; 2. Clean and Efficient Transportation; 3. Clean Water; 4. Clean Air; and 5. Conservation of Forest and Wetland Ecosystems. Short-term, medium-term and long-term goals were identified under each of the five goals. The U.S. and China also reached agreement on the establishment of a goal for energy efficiency to address: 1. Energy efficiency in buildings and communities; 2. Industrial energy efficiency; and 3. Consumer recognition of energy efficient products. An action plan detailing cooperation between the United States and China will be developed before the next meeting of the SED.** Cooperation on Energy and Environment Challenges** Additional steps to enhance collaboration between the two countries to promote energy security and further environment sustainability reached at the fifth Cabinet-level SED meeting include:** REPORTS**

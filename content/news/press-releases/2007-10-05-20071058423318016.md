Deputy Secretary Kimmitt travels to New Orleans Friday to award $3.9 billion in tax credits to organizations investing in rural and urban low-income communities across the United States. These tax credits are intended to spur new private sector investment in communities in need across the United States and encourage continued redevelopment and reconstruction in the Hurricane Katrina Gulf Opportunity Zone, said Deputy Secretary Kimmitt. The vision of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund is to help give all Americans access to affordable credit, capital, and financial services.

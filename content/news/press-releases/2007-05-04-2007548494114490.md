The Labor Department today announced that 88,000 jobs were created in April. Our economy has now added jobs for 44 straight months and the unemployment rate remains low at 4.5%. We see hopeful signs that growth will pick up through the year; business investment looks set to rebound, consumer spending is sustaining growth and strong global activity should propel exports going forward, said Asst Sec Swagel.

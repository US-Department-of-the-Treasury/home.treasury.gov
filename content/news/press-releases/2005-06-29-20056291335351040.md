I applaud President Bush for today issuing the WMD Proliferation Financing Executive Order, aimed at freezing the assets of proliferators of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and the missiles that carry them.  This Order sends a clear message: if you deal in weapons of mass destruction, you're not going to use the U.S. financial system to bankroll or facilitate your activities.

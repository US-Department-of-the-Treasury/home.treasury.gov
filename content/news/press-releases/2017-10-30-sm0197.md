 **WASHINGTON  - -**The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of net marketable borrowing for the October – December 2017 and January – March 2018 quarters: 
- During the October – December 2017 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $275 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $205 billion.  The borrowing estimate is $226 billion lower than announced in July 2017.  The decrease in borrowing is driven primarily by changes in cash balance assumptions.1
 
- During the January – March 2018 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $512 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $300 billion.
 During the July – September 2017 quarter, Treasury borrowed $189 billion in net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $159 billion.  In July 2017, Treasury estimated net marketable borrowing of $96 billion and assumed an end-of-September cash balance of $60 billion.[1]  The increase in borrowing was driven primarily by the higher ending cash balance. Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 1, 2017. ###[1]

Treasury Secretary John Snow said Friday morning that he would not read too much into advance estimates of fourth quarter 2005 GDP. Saying the numbers are somewhat anomalous, reflecting some special factors, he went on to point out that they are not consistent with other data on theU.S.economy which paint a picture of good growth. The American economy is on a good course and I am very confident. I am optimistic about the first quarter and the year ahead and am confident that we will see strong growth for the year.

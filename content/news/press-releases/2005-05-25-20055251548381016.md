Secretary John W. Snow today addressed a meeting of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission. As my son often tells me, young people don't believe Social Security will be there for them, he said. So they want to learn about how to invest and save for their own retirement. The President and I hope that they will have the opportunity to save, to build a nest egg, as part of the Social Security system, and I believe that this interest in financial learning among younger generations will really help the launch and success of personal accounts.

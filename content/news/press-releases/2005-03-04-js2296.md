Today's announcement that 262,000 new jobs have been created is good news for America and the growth of our economy. More than just a statistic, this number means that 262,000 Americans looking for a job, have now found a job.

In addition to continued job growth, we've also seen new jobless claims decline and productivity continue to expand. President Bush is committed to keeping the economy on the path of healthy growth by making the tax cuts permanent, reducing the burden of frivolous lawsuits, and strengthening social security.  The President's leadership on economic policy is clearly moving the economy in the right direction.

- During the October – December 2015 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $344 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $325 billion.This borrowing estimate is $74 billion higher than announced in August 2015.The increase in borrowing is due to changes in cash balance assumptions.[1]
  
- During the January – March 2016 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $165 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $260 billion.
  During the July – September 2015 quarter, Treasury issued $133 billion in net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $199 billion.  In August 2015, Treasury estimated $127 billion in net marketable debt and assumed an end-of-June cash balance of $225 billion.  The modest net increase in borrowing was driven by an increase in financing needs partially offset by a lower ending cash balance.1   Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 4, 2015.   ###

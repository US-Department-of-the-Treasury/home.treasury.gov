Today, the Government of Thailand publicly released its economic reform commitments under the IMF program, including a detailed timetable on financial sector restructuring. We welcome this announcement and it is now very important that Thailand carry through in implementing these commitments. We have a strong interest in seeing Thailand succeed in restoring financial stability and market confidence.

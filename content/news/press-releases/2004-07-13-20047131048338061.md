Ohio-born Treasury Secretary John Snow is in Cleveland, Ohio today to tour a local business and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. He also discussed terrorist financing, saying The work to track and shut down the financial network of terror is one of the most critical jobs of our government today. One of the many considerable achievements of the 2001 Patriot Act was an increased ability to do that job.

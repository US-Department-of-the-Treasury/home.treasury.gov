The Treasury Department today issued comprehensive guidance on Health Savings Accounts, designed to help providers establish HSAs and consumers to enjoy their benefits.

Health Savings Accounts are designed to help individuals take more control over how their health care dollars are spent and save for future medical and retiree health expenses on a tax-free basis, said Secretary Snow. At a time when health care costs are rising rapidly and individuals, families and employers are struggling to find lower-cost alternatives, HSAs are a terrific option that I think every American ought to consider.

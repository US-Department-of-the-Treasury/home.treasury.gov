**WASHINGTON** – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in partnership with The White House Council on Women and Girls, convened a Women in Finance Symposium in celebration of Women's History Month, bringing together senior officials from across the government's economic agencies, private sector leaders and women entering the field for a series of panel discussions to recognize the contributions of women and to discuss the best means to foster success among future generations of women in the finance sectors.

Our hope is that this symposium will help re-energize an important national conversation – one that takes priority in both the private and public sectors and one that ultimately makes a real difference in increasing the presence and influence of women in the world of finance, said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.

Following opening remarks from Secretary Geithner and Treasurer Rosie Rios, the symposium featured a panel discussion – Women Drivers of the Economic Recovery: Pathways to Success – with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Sheila Bair, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro, Council of Economic Advisors Chair Christina Romer, Small Business Administration Administrator Karen Mills and Congressional Oversight Panel Chair Elizabeth Warren and moderated by Maria Bartiromo of CNBC. A second panel, moderated by Liz Claman of Fox Business Network and designed to address the landscape and challenges for women in finance, included President of the American Council on Education Molly Broad, Senior U.S. Investment Strategist for Goldman Sachs Abby Joseph Cohen, Director in the Strategic Client Group of Morgan Stanley Carla Harris, CEO of Citi Personal Wealth Management Deborah McWhinney and President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board member Laura Tyson. The symposium's closing session featured White House Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President Valerie Jarrett.

Across the country, at schools including Columbia University, George Washington University, Howard University, the Stockton College of New Jersey, and Pepperdine University, among others, university students and young professionals gathered for watch parties to engage in the symposium via[webcast](http://www.yorkmedia.com/treasury/webcasts2010.html).  In the week leading up to the event and live throughout the symposium, students submitted questions via email and[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/ustreasurydept)that were incorporated in the various panel discussions.

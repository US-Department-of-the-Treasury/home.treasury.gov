**WASHINGTON** —The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced that the future permanent headquarters of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will be located at 1700 G Street, NW in Washington, DC.   “With its headquarters in the heart of Washington, DC. – just across the street from the White House complex – the new agency will offer a very tangible presence for anyone who comes to our nation’s capital,” said Elizabeth Warren, Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the CFPB.  “The consumer bureau belongs to the American people, so we aim to make its headquarters welcoming to the public.”   The building will contain approximately 300,000 useable square feet.  Before the CFPB moves in, major renovations are needed to make more efficient use of space and to update the building to current energy and environmental standards.    Although space planning is still in its early stages, the CFPB implementation team plans for the building to include a first floor that is open for regular educational programs, including interactive kiosks and 21st century learning centers.  The goal is to make the CFPB headquarters, which is currently occupied by the Office of Thrift Supervision, a place where Americans of all ages can learn more about managing their finances and about the nation’s first bureau dedicated to making the markets for consumer financial products and services work for American families.​

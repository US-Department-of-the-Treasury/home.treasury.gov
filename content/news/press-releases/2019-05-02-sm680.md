**Washington **– Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is publishing[*A Framework for OFAC Compliance Commitments*](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/framework_ofac_cc.pdf)in order to provide organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction, as well as foreign entities that conduct business in or with the United States or U.S. persons, or that use U.S.-origin goods or services, with OFAC’s perspective on the essential components of a sanctions compliance program.

“As the United States continues to enhance our sanctions programs, ensuring that the private sector implements strong and effective compliance programs that protect the U.S. financial system from abuse is a key part of our strategy,” said Sigal P. Mandelker, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.

“OFAC developed this framework in our continuing effort to strengthen sanctions compliance practices across the board,” said Andrea M. Gacki, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control.  “This underlines our commitment to engage with the private sector to further promote understanding of, and compliance with, sanctions requirements.”

The[document](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/framework_ofac_cc.pdf)also outlines how OFAC may incorporate these components into its evaluation of apparent violations and resolution of investigations resulting in settlements.  Finally, the[document](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/framework_ofac_cc.pdf)includes an appendix that offers a brief analysis of some of the root causes of apparent violations of U.S. economic and trade sanctions programs OFAC has identified during its investigative process.

**WASHINGTON** – Today, the Republic of Tunisia successfully closed on its offering of a $500 million sovereign bond issuance guaranteed by the United States of America.  This loan guarantee, following earlier guarantees in 2012 and 2014, underscores the enduring and strong commitment of the United States to help Tunisia advance its democratic transition.  The loan guarantee supports Tunisia as it pursues important economic reforms to provide a foundation for robust, shared economic growth, while also furthering Tunisia’s ability to access global capital markets.

  Today’s issuance of a $500 million, five-year Tunisian sovereign bond on international markets is backed by a 100 percent guarantee by the U.S. government of the repayment of principal and interest, and was priced at a coupon rate of 1.416 percent.     # # #

FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-776

I applaud Senate Finance Committee Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Baucus and the Committee for their hard work in moving the FSC/ETI legislation forward. The Administration's top priority is getting a bill enacted that complies with the WTO ruling and avoids triggering $4 billion in EU trade sanctions. The EU has stated the Congress needs to pass bills out of both houses by the end of the year to avoid such sanctions. We encourage Congress to replace ETI in a way that improves the competitiveness of America's manufacturers and other job creators. It is critically important that we continue to work together to get legislation enacted.

No one looks forward to tax day, but for millions of taxpayers across the country, today will be less painful thanks to the President's tax cuts.  Nationwide, 110 million taxpayers will see their tax bill reduced thanks to the tax relief supported by President Bush and enacted by Congress.  That extra money in the hands of America's families has helped to fuel the economic recovery.  Now, to continue this period of economic growth, we must make tax relief permanent so families can plan ahead for the future.  We must also reform the tax code to make it simpler, fairer and more growth oriented.

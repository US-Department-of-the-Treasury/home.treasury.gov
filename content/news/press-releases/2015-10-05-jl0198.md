​**WASHINGTON** – U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew today released a statement following the conclusion of negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP):  “The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a comprehensive and high-standard agreement that will increase opportunities for American workers and businesses, encourage competition, promote open trade and investment, and lift up our middle class in a rapidly evolving global economy.  I applaud Ambassador Froman and our international partners for delivering an agreement that lives up to our ambitions and will deliver more high-quality jobs for Americans, as well as closer economic integration across the TPP region.   “Trade Promotion Authority made clear the importance of addressing unfair currency practices.  In furtherance of that, we are taking steps to strengthen our cooperation with our partners on macroeconomic and exchange rate policies and promote our shared interest in preventing unfair currency practices.”   # # #

**WASHINGTON** –Today, the Republic of Tunisia closed on its offering of a $500 million sovereign bond issuance guaranteed by the United States of America, acting through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

 

As President Obama noted during the April 2014 visit of Tunisian Prime Minister Joma’a to Washington, this loan guarantee is only one part of our assistance, which aims to help the Government of Tunisia “meet some of its reform goals and lay the foundation for great success in the future.” This guarantee reinforces our firm commitment to the people of Tunisia by strengthening its government’s ability to maintain access to international financing and to achieve its economic development and reform goals.

 

Today’s issuance of a $500 million, seven-year Tunisian sovereign bond was supported by a 100 percent guarantee of the repayment of principal and interest by the U.S. government. The $500 million issuance was priced at a coupon rate of 2.452 percent.

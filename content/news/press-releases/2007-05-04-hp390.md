The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today released the*Impact Report on Economic Sanctions Against Colombian Drug Cartels, *which reviews OFAC's highly effective efforts to expose and isolate significant Colombian narcotics traffickers and their associates and to disrupt and dismantle their business empires.

Since it's inception in 1995, the Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNT) program has been extremely successful in disrupting the financial operations of Colombian drug lords and stripping the cartels of their ill-gotten gains, said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin.

The*Impact Report*details the illicit activities of each of the 22 Colombian drug cartel principals and organizations that have been targeted by OFAC.The report alsofocuses on specific highlights of the SDNT program, including the historic September 2006 plea agreement between the United States Government and the leaders ofColombia's infamousCalidrug cartel, Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela.This sanctions program was established by Executive Order 12978.

We believe the report will be valuable to the Congress and law enforcement agencies, both domestic and abroad.The report will also inform foreign governments, fostering closer coordination in fighting the scourge of narcotics trafficking, Szubin continued.

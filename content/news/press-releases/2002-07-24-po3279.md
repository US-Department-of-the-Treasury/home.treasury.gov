Secretary O'Neill's trip to Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina has been rescheduled for August 5-7. The Secretary has decided to delay his trip by one week, as Congress is at a critical juncture in completing work on corporate accountability, Trade Promotion Authority, and homeland security -- three important components of the President's agenda to strengthen our economic recovery.

Because Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay are important US partners, this delay is as brief as possible.

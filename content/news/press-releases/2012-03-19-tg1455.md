   **WASHINGTON** – At its annual meeting, the Board of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) today approved $200 million in grants to Haiti for 2012. The United States proposed these annual grants to Haiti over a 10-year period as part of its contribution to the Bank’s General Capital Increase in 2010.   “The United States’ commitment to securing funding for Haiti through the Inter-American Development Bank illustrates how we are using our leadership role in this institution to leverage the Bank’s expertise and resources to help put Haiti back on the path to sustainable growth,” said Lael Brainard, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs.   The funding will provide critical resources to support the IDB’s continuing work in priority sectors, including education reform, private sector development, energy, agriculture, transportation, and water and sanitation. In 2011, the funding provided to Haiti by the IDB provided financing for 800 temporary classrooms, the building and rehabilitation of 160 kilometers of roads, and the vaccination of 50 percent of Haitian farmers against swine fever and other diseases.   ###

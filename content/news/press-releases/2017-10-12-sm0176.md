WASHINGTON –
Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin made the following statement today regarding the Administration’s executive order on promoting healthcare choice and competition across the United States:
“I applaud the President for taking this important step to relieve the American people of the burdens of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This executive order will empower individuals and small businesses to improve their healthcare coverage, and unleash the power of the free market to increase accessibility, affordability, and options. By reducing the regulatory barriers that limit choice and competition, we will make sure that Americans have access to the healthcare coverage they deserve.”

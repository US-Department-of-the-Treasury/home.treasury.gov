Today’s employment report demonstrates, beyond a doubt, the broad-based strength and continuing momentum of the U.S. economy. The addition of 248,000 jobs in May is encouraging news for America’s workers and growing businesses. In nine consecutive months of growth we’ve seen the addition of nearly 1.5 million jobs to the workforce, more than a million so far this year. Today’s report is especially encouraging for the manufacturing sector. In four months of growth, 91,000 manufacturing jobs were created – the best four-month period since 1998.

The President’s timely action to lift the burden of tax relief on millions of American families and businesses has resulted in a strong and stable recovery. The President’s ongoing economic leadership will ensure that American companies continue to hire and the economy continues to expand.

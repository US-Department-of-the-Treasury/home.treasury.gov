HP-228

In his State of the Union Address, President Bush will announce proposals to make health insurance available and affordable for more Americans. The new standard deduction for health insurance will make the tax system more progressive, with the benefits concentrated on low- and middle-income Americans, and will increase the number of people with health insurance.

Taxes as a percent of income would fall for the first four quintiles - the bottom 80 percent of the population.

Secretary Snow is in Independence, Missouri today to talk to local business leaders about the President's efforts to strengthen the economy. The President's tax relief is working for the people of Missouri, with more than 2 million taxpayers paying lower income tax bills in 2004, the Secretary said. At this point, it is critical to make that tax relief permanent, and to continue lifting the barriers to growth in other areas as well – by making health care more affordable, abusive lawsuits more scarce, and energy costs more reasonable.

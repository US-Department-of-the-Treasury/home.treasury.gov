This month's report, showing more jobs, more hours worked and higher wages tells a positive story. There is a lot of momentum for more good jobs and for rising wages. The outlook for the future is very strong.



We've had 32 straight months of job growth, totaling more than 5.2 million new jobs since the President's tax relief took effect. More people are working than ever before and they are earning more money. Today's report shows average hourly earnings have risen 3.8 percent over the past 12 months their largest increase in nearly five years.



It's encouraging to see so much good economic news. Clearly we are on the right path. Making tax relief permanent will sustain U.S. economic strength. Congress needs to act.

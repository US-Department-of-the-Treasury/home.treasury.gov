Last night, Treasury Secretary John Snow spoke to the Council on Foreign Relations inNew York Cityabout the importance of global economic growth and the opportunity that G8 nations have to improve the delivery and impact of aid. He said that The role of the G8 today, following the mixed results of 50 years of development assistance, is not just to do more, but to do better – to continue to improve how development assistance is both delivered and received in order to ensure the biggest bang for each buck of development assistance.

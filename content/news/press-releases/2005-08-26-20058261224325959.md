Health Savings Accounts are a great way to get good health insurance at an affordable price. More than 30 percent of Hispanics do not have health insurance coverage.  HSAs help to bring affordable quality health care within reach, U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral said in a speech today to the California Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.To help Spanish-speakers better understand how HSAs work, today we are releasing a new Spanish-language brochure that will be available on the Treasury Web site.

Over the past ten years, Jim Wolfensohn has been an outstanding leader of the World Bank.  I have worked closely with him over the past two years on a number of initiatives including President Bush's grants and measurable results programs, the reconstruction ofIraqandAfghanistan, among countless other issues. I particularly want to commend him for his leadership on anti-corruption efforts.

I am rewarded to have known him as a colleague and a friend.  Because of Jim's leadership, the World Bank today is a more dynamic and effective development organization.  I view his accomplishments as historic.  Jim's tireless efforts to assist the world's poor have been marked by unmatched passion and accomplishment.  The world's poorest people have clearly benefited from Jim's tenure at the World Bank. He deserves great thanks and praise for his service.   I look forward to working with him over the next six months as he continues to lead the Bank.   His counsel will be invaluable as we go through the transition process.

Last Friday, the United Nations agreed to the request of the Government of Iraq to work together on an International Compact for Iraq. We welcome and applaud the UN's active participation in this important initiative.

We commend Iraq for its commitment, as part of this Compact, to take a series of steps to achieve objectives in economic and reconstruction areas.  In exchange, we expect the international community will provide sustained political and economic support to help them achieve these goals.

As President Bush pledged last week following meetings at Camp David, the United States is prepared to support this endeavor by working closely with the Government of Iraq, the UN, the International Financial Institutions, and partners in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, to help the Iraqis secure support for their new government.

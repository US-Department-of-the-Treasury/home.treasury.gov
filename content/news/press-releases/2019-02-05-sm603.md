U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today following President Trump’s State of the Union Address:
“President Trump’s pro-growth, pro-worker policies are delivering rising wages and historically low unemployment for the benefit of all Americans.  Tax cuts, regulatory relief, and modernized trade deals are having real, positive impacts for families and businesses all across our country.  I applaud the President’s commitment to work with Congress on bipartisan solutions to our most pressing national security challenges, and to protect American workers.”

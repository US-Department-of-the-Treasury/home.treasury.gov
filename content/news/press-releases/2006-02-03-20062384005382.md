In his comments on the January employment report Friday morning, Treasury Secretary John Snow said: Today we have terrific news that the unemployment rate has now dropped to 4.7 percent – the lowest it has been since July of 2001 – and that 193,000 new jobs were created in January. On average, 200,000 jobs have been created each month over the past three months. People who have been unemployed are finding it easier and easier to find jobs.  These numbers are a positive indicator that the American economy continues to hold great promise for all Americans who are seeking employment.

Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions David G. Nason discussed efforts to strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. capital markets Tuesday in London, England. Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. has said promoting the competitiveness of U.S. capital markets is a vital issue to strengthening the U.S. economy. As part of his plan for strengthening American capital markets, the Secretary has called for an examination of the structure of the U.S. financial regulatory system. The Department will release its recommendations for improvement early next year.

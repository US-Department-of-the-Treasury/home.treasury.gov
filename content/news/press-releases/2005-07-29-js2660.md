Janice Gardner was confirmed by the Senate on Thursday to serve as the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Assistant Secretary for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA).

I congratulate Janice on being confirmed as the Treasury's first Assistant Secretary for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis.  Janice brings to the Treasury an expertise garnered over the 20 plus years she worked in the Intelligence Community, said Treasury Secretary John W. Snow.

Janice's know-how will further advance the Treasury's role in attacking the financial underpinnings of national security threats, Snow continued.

Gardner was serving as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for OIA when she was nominated for the Assistant Secretary position by President George W. Bush on May 13, 2005.   She previously served as the Senior Intelligence Liaison Officer at the Department of the Treasury.

Under Janice's leadership and capability, the Treasury Department will make a significant contribution to the U.S. Government's overall efforts to combat the financial webs of those threatening our national security, said Stuart Levey, Treasury's Under Secretary for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).

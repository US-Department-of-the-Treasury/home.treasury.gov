On behalf of the United States, I wish to extend my congratulations to Ilan Goldfajn on his election as President of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
The IDB plays a vital role in advancing the economic, social and environmental well-being of Latin America and the Caribbean.  The United States looks forward to working with President Goldfajn to implement the set of reforms shareholders have laid out to bolster sustainable, inclusive, resilient development; private sector-led growth; climate ambition; and enhance the IDB’s institutional effectiveness.
I would also like to convey my deep appreciation to the IDB’s talented and dedicated staff for their tireless commitment to continue delivering for the diverse needs of the region through this uncertain period.
The United States stands by the entire IDB Group as the premier development finance institution serving the region.  We are counting on President Goldfajn to lead this organization to be an engine of change and progress for our neighbors across Latin America and the Caribbean.

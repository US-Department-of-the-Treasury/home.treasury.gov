**WASHINGTON –** The final results from the annual survey of foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities at the end of June 2024 were released today on the Treasury website at [https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/us-liabilities-to-foreigners-from-holdings-of-us-securities](https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system/us-liabilities-to-foreigners-from-holdings-of-us-securities). The survey was undertaken jointly by Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The next survey will cover holdings at the end of June 2024; preliminary data are expected to be released by February 27, 2026.

Complementary surveys measuring U.S. holdings of foreign securities are also carried out annually. Data from the most recent survey, reporting on securities held at year-end 2024, are currently being processed. Preliminary results are expected to be reported by August 29, 2025.

The survey measured the value of foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities as of June 30, 2024, to be $30,881 billion, with $16,878 billion held in U.S. equities, $12,688 billion in U.S. long-term debt securities [/1] (of which $1,588 billion are holdings of asset-backed securities (ABS) [/2] and $11,100 billion are holdings of non-ABS securities), and $1,314 billion held in U.S. short-term debt securities. The previous survey, conducted as of June 30, 2023, measured the value of total foreign holdings of U.S. securities at $25,686 billion, with holdings of $13,719 billion in U.S. equities, $11,967 billion in U.S. long-term debt securities, and $1,186 billion in U.S. short-term debt securities (see Table A).

 

[/1] Long-term debt securities have an original term-to-maturity of over one year.

[/2] Asset-backed securities are backed by pools of assets, such as pools of residential home mortgages or credit card receivables, which give the security owners claims against the cash flows generated by the underlying assets. Unlike most other debt securities, these securities generally repay both principal and interest on a regular basis, reducing the principal outstanding with each payment cycle.

In a speech to the National Chamber Foundation yesterday, Treasury Secretary John Snow emphasized the strength of the country's economic performance and its underlying economic fundamentals, which foretell our economic future. He noted that, thanks to responsible economic leadership from the President and Federal Reserve Board, our economy is now unmistakably in a trend of expansion. GDP growth is averaging over four percent annually. Four and a half million new jobs have been created since May of 2003, 2 million of them in the last year alone. Unemployment is running lower than the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, U.S. equity markets are rising, and household wealth is at an all-time high. The U.S. is the picture of economic health and we remain, as the President often notes, the economic envy of the world.

The Treasury Department is releasing today the concluding statement by the staff of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) following this year’s Article IV consultation with the United States. This statement represents IMF staff’s independent judgment and assessment of U.S. economic performance and policies.

Release of this statement is consistent with the United States' longstanding, strong support for enhanced transparency of the IMF. The United States also plans to release the IMF staff report and Public Information Notice on the U.S. Article IV review following the Executive Board’s discussion of the mission later this summer.

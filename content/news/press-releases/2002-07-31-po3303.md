Today, at 1:30pm, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill will host a roundtable discussion with business and industry leaders at the Treasury Department to discuss the U.S. economy.  In several broadcast appearances over the weekend, Secretary O'Neill said that despite swings in the stock market the economy is fundamentally strong, but it is essential for Congress to implement key items on President Bush's agenda - namely trade promotion authority, pension reform, and terrorism risk insurance - that will help ensure good jobs for Americans, promote economic growth and strengthen the economy.

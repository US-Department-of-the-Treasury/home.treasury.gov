WASHINGTON – Earlier today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen spoke with French Minister of Finance, the Economy, and the Recovery Bruno Le Maire. Following the historic agreement by the G7 in earlier this summer – which was later supported by 134 countries representing more than 90% of the world’s GDP – to reform international tax rules, Secretary Yellen today expressed continued support for ongoing efforts to improve the global tax system. Secretary Yellen also stressed the importance of reaching a compromise on the withdrawal of digital services taxes. Secretary Yellen conveyed appreciation for Minister Le Maire’s dedication to the effort of reforming the global tax system so it is equipped to meet the needs of today’s global economy. She also discussed with Finance Minister Le Maire the need for continued cooperation between the U.S., France, and other G20 members to enhance support for low-income countries to mitigate further divergence in the global economic recovery.

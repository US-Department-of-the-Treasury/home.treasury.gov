In a speech at the University of Mississippi yesterday afternoon, Treasury Secretary John Snow addressed recent criticism of the President's economic policies, saying that From where I stand, and from where 5.2 million American workers with new jobs stand, the President's economic policies have been an unambiguous success. He went on to say that he is frankly puzzled by critics who call for tax increases – a reversal of effective policy – at this point of success for workers and families. These critics turn a blind eye to the economic success of the tax cuts – and that success is big enough that it's pretty hard to miss.

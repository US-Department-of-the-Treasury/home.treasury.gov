In a meeting Thursday to discuss issues surrounding sovereign wealth funds, officials from Treasury and the governments of Singapore and Abu Dhabi agreed on a set of principles for sovereign wealth fund investments and recipient countries. The U.S. welcomes sovereign wealth fund investment and looks forward to continuing to work with these two countries and others to support the initiatives underway at the IMF and OECD to develop best practices for sovereign wealth funds and recipient countries, said Paulson. The principles we agreed to here today will further those efforts.

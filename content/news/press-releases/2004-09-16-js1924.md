JS-1924

 

The IRS and Treasury Department today released a notice that provides that the temporary housing of displaced individuals in low-income units in Florida will not cause the owners to lose low-income housing credits.Because of the widespread devastation to housing caused by the Hurricane Charley and Hurricane Frances, the IRS and Treasury Department have temporarily suspended certain income limitation requirements for qualified low-income housing projects in Florida.

The widespread damage caused by the hurricanes left thousands of Floridians homeless, said Greg Jenner, Acting Assistant Treasury Secretary for Tax Policy.We hope that providing this disaster relief will allow Florida to temporarily house many of the needy whose homes were destroyed. The Treasury Department and the IRS would entertain similar requests from other states affected by recent natural disasters.

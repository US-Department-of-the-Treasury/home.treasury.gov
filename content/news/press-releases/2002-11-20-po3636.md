I applaud the Congress for completing action on President Bush's bold plan to concentrate our homeland security resources in a single Cabinet department. We will now move forward to redeploy the resources of the federal government to meet the challenge posed by terrorism.  The men and women of the US Customs Service and the US Secret Service serve their country with great dedication.  Bringing them together with other security agencies under one roof with a singular focus will enhance collaboration and efficiency in the federal government's efforts to protect the American people.

​The below statement on the European Commission’s decision on Apple is attributable to a Treasury Spokesperson:   Treasury has reviewed the European Commission's decision against Apple. We continue to believe‎ the Commission is retroactively applying a sweeping new State aid theory that is contrary to well-established legal principles, calls into question the tax rules of individual countries, and threatens to undermine the overall business climate in Europe‎. Moreover, it threatens to erode America's corporate tax base. To be clear, we agree that tax avoidance is a serious problem around the world. We are committed to continuing to work with the Commission and other international partners, such as through the OECD, toward our shared objective of preventing the erosion of our corporate tax bases.‎

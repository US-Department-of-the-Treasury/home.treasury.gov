We welcome Prime Minister Hashimoto's announcement of steps to stimulate the Japanese economy. We look forward to seeing the details later this month. What is crucial is that Japan move quickly to put in place a strong program.



We share the concern expressed by the Japanese Prime Minister about recent weakness in the yen, and in that context we welcome the action undertaken by the Japanese authorities in the exchange market to support the value of the yen.

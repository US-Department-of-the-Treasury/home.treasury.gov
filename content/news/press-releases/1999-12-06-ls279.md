FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-279

We have received the Special Master's report today and will respond to the Court as appropriate.

The Treasury and Justice Departments have cooperated fully with the Special Master in his inquiry, and will continue to cooperate with him and the Court. The Justice and Treasury Departments have devoted substantial new resources to handle this litigation, and the government will continue to move ahead to make improvements in the administration of monies held on behalf of individual Indians. The Treasury Department referred this matter to its Inspector General in June and looks forward to cooperating fully with his inquiry.

We are, of course, disappointed in certain of the Special Master's conclusions regarding the government's conduct. As the Court noted, the Report does not constitute a final determination, and the individuals mentioned in it and the government will have an opportunity to respond. We are committed to cooperating with the Court to resolve all issues fully and fairly. In fairness to all concerned, we caution against drawing conclusions prematurely.

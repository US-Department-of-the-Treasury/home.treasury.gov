Secretary John Snow is in New York City today, speaking to the Bond Market Association about the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve Social Security for future generations. The President doesn't think it would be wise to turn a blind eye to the reports of the non-partisan Social Security actuaries, which tell us that the program faces a long-term deficit of $11 trillion. We need lasting, meaningful reform.

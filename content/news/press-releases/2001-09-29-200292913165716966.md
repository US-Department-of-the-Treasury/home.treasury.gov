Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill encouraged the world's leaders in finance and economic policy to continue progress in preventing and resolving international financial crises in emerging market economies.  Secretary O'Neill called on the IMF to continue to improve its ability to quickly identify and prevent potential crises.  Secretary O'Neill and his G7 partners were able to report progress on efforts to resolve sovereign debt crises when they occur.  Secretary O'Neill also continued to press the World Bank and all multilateral development banks to insist on measurable results from loan and grant programs -- and to support countries that follow sound economic policies.  And at a unique meeting with Finance Ministers from the Western Hemisphere, Secretary O'Neill led discussions on strategies to increase productivity, economic growth, and the standard of living for millions of people in the Americas.

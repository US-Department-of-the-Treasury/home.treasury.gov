WASHINGTON – This week the Department of the Treasury’s Office of State and Local Finance kicked off its “Summer Series on Resources for the State and Local Government Climate Transition.” These monthly virtual convenings will share climate-oriented tools and resources for the municipal sector and will include presentations from federal agencies, industry organizations, and academic institutions.

 

The first convening included Treasury staff and 40 participants from trade associations, coalitions, think tanks, networks, and other organizations that support state, local, territorial, and tribal governments. They discussed tools and resources for managing climate-related financial risk and integrating climate-related factors in capital and budget processes. Speakers and presenters included:

* The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)

* University of Washington (Department of Urban Design and Planning)

* Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES)

 

Treasury looks forward to additional convenings and supporting efforts by state, local, territorial and tribal government to adapt to the challenges and opportunities presented by climate change and the climate transition.

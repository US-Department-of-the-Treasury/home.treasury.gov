**On the Swearing in of Brian Roseboro to be Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance**



Today, I have the honor of swearing in Brian C. Roseboro as Treasury’s new Under Secretary forDomesticFinance.  In his new role, Brian will serve as my top advisor on all aspects of domestic finance including the formulation of policy and legislation in the areas of financial institutions, public debt management, capital markets, government financial management services, federal lending, fiscal affairs, government-sponsored enterprises, and community development.



Brian has been an invaluable part of the Treasury team since 2001.  His leadership, experience and knowledge will serve not only the Treasury Department, but also the American people well as we continue to pursue the goals of greater economic growth and job creation.  The Treasury Department is fortunate to have Brian on board, and we thank Brian and his family for their commitment to public service.

Today's introduction of the President's Retirement Savings Accounts (RSAs) proposal in both the U.S. House and Senate holds great promise for Americans eager for more options and more control over their own retirement.

 

Retirement Savings Accounts will be a terrific tool to help Americans plan and save for their retirement, with no limitations based on age or income status. They will also simplify saving, which will help Americans reach the goal that we all share: a secure retirement.

 

I commend Representative Sam Johnson and Senator Craig Thomas for introducing this legislation; they understand what Americans need and want when it comes to saving for the future. Along with the legislative proposal that they previously introduced on Lifetime Savings Accounts, RSAs will make saving simple for everyone and for every purpose. I commend Representative Johnson and Senator Thomas for introducing this important legislative proposal that will help all Americans plan for a financially secure future.

**WASHINGTON –** Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a [Request for Comment](https://www.regulations.gov/docket/TREAS-DO-2025-0070) required by the [GENIUS Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/07/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-signs-genius-act-into-law/), which furthers the Administration’s policy of supporting the responsible growth and use of digital assets, as outlined in [Executive Order (E.O.) 14178 on “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/).”  Today’s request for comment fulfills Treasury’s obligation pursuant to section 9(a) of the GENIUS Act, which creates a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in the United States. The GENIUS Act and E.O. 14178 together promote U.S. leadership in digital assets and bolster U.S. national security.

This request for comment offers the opportunity for interested individuals and organizations to provide feedback on innovative or novel methods, techniques, or strategies that regulated financial institutions use, or could potentially use, to detect illicit activity involving digital assets.  In particular, Treasury asks commenters about application program interfaces, artificial intelligence, digital identity verification, and use of blockchain technology and monitoring.

Innovative tools are critical to advancing efforts to address illicit finance risks but can also present new resource burdens for financial institutions.  As required by the GENIUS Act, Treasury will use public comments to inform research on the effectiveness, costs, privacy and cybersecurity risks, and other considerations related to these tools.

As provided in Section 9(a) of the GENIUS Act, members of the public should submit comments within 60 days of publication in the Federal Register by October 17. Comments responding to this request will be publicly viewable at [www.regulations.gov](http://www.regulations.gov/).

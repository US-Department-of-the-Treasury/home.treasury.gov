Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill made the following statement on Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus' draft mark of the Economic Recovery and Assistance for American Workers Act of 2001:

The President has repeatedly stated his desire for Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to pass an economic stimulus bill. The President spelled out the component parts of a stimulus package that is in the best interest of American consumers, employers and the overall US economy. The plan unveiled by Senator Baucus doesn't meet that test. I'll continue to work with Senators to achieve a better product.

The interest of the American people and the American economy are not partisan. Chairman Baucus' mark falls short of meeting the real interest of the American people.

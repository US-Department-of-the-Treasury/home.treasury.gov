Deputy Secretary Stuart E. Eizenstat praised the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims (ICHEIC) for its announcement today that it is initiating the claims process for unpaid insurance that date from the Nazi era.

Mr. Eizenstat said, The announcement today that the ICHEIC is beginning a massive, world-wide outreach program to identify those with unpaid insurance claims that date to the Nazi era represents the latest tangible evidence of the renewed commitment, of both governments and the international business community, to seek justice for Holocaust survivors and their families.

In particular, Mr. Eizenstat praised the role of former Secretary of State Eagleburger who serves as ICHEIC Chairman.

Established by Presidents Bush and Hu, the US-China Strategic Economic Dialogue is a focused and effective framework for addressing issues of mutual concern. By prioritizing issues in the broader context of our bilateral economic relationship, the SED gives direction and creates momentum for the many existing bilateral mechanisms we use to foster cooperation and resolve concerns across the spectrum of economic issues. Getting the U.S.-China relationship right, which includes China implementing the reforms it has committed to, and doing so on a timeline consistent with its place in the global economy, is absolutely essential to China's future economic growth and stability. And China's growth and stability is a vital issue for the global economy, said Secretary Paulson.

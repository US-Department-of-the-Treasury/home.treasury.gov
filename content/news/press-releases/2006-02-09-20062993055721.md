In Testimony before the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday morning, Treasury Secretary John Snow discussed the President's FY 2007 budget proposal. This budget represents the President's dedication to fiscal discipline, an efficient federal government and the continuation of a thriving U.S. economy, Snow said. The President's 2007 Budget continues the successful pro-growth policies that have encouraged robust economic growth and job creation, and in his testimony Secretary Snow emphasized the need to avoid a tax increase by making the President's tax cuts permanent.

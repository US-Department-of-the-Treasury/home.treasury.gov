Credit unions are depository institutions that accept deposits and make loans.  As of June 30, 2000, there were 10,477 federally insured credit unions with $426.8 billion in assets.  Although the average credit union is small, with only $41 million in assets, those with more than $50 million in assets hold more than 79 percent of all credit union assets, even though they account for only 15 percent of all credit unions.

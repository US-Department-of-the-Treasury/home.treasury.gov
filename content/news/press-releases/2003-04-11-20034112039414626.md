I look forward to working with the full Congress to swiftly enact tax relief necessary to grow the economy and create jobs.The budget resolution which passed today provides for $550 billion in tax relief for the President’s Jobs and Growth package, and I will work closely with President Bush and the Congress to obtain the greatest amount of tax relief possible to grow the economy and create jobs for the American people.

**WASHINGTON** –U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Jacob J. Lew released a statement following the signing today of a $1 billion loan guarantee agreement for Ukraine in Kyiv.  This marks the second U.S. loan guarantee agreement for Ukraine and underscores the United States’ continued support for Ukraine’s economic reform agenda.

 

“Since we signed our first loan guarantee agreement one year ago, Ukraine has worked closely with the IMF, the World Bank, the United States, and other members of the international community to implement a robust reform program that will help stabilize Ukraine’s economy and lay the groundwork for future growth and prosperity,” said Secretary Lew.

 

“While Ukraine continues along the path of economic reform, we have been working with our international partners to redouble efforts to support full implementation of the Minsk agreements, including by imposing costs on Russia for its aggressive acts in eastern Ukraine.

 

“Today’s $1 billion loan guarantee agreement is part of a comprehensive financial package, involving both official and private sectors, designed to support Ukraine as it puts in place an ambitious reform program.  Ukraine has taken critical reforms already, and its commitment to making a decisive break with the corruption and stagnation of the past is clear.  This progress must continue so that the people of Ukraine can realize the prosperity and stability they deserve.”

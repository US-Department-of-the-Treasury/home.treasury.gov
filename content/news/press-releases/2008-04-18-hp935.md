The Treasury Department welcomes Subcommittee Chairman Kanjorski and Ranking Member Pryce's introduction of legislation to create a federal insurance adviser within the Department of the Treasury. This legislation, similar to a proposal in Treasury's*Blueprint for a Modernized Regulatory Structure*, would help the United States address international regulatory issues affecting our markets' competitiveness.

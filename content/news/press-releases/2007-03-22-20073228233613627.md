Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey testified before Congress Wednesday on Iran's illicit use of the international financial system to support terrorism and advance the regime's nuclear program.  The Treasury developed the financial component of the Administration's overall Iran strategy at the direction of Secretary Rice and Secretary Paulson and in close coordination with other agencies.  Through our teamwork, we have crafted an innovative strategy to highlight the reckless and dangerous conduct of the Iranian regime, deter Tehran's dangerous activities through the use of financial measures, and prevent the regime's abuse and manipulation of the international financial system, said Levey.

Secretary Snow on Friday met with financial sector leaders in New York about the need to strengthen and preserve the Social Security system. The financial leaders I met with share the President's concern that Social Security needs to be fixed, he said. They know that if the government doesn't pursue and enact meaningful changes now, the Social Security system will eventually need to be propped up with massive tax increases, which will send terrible shockwaves through our economy. This issue is important to all Americans, and it's important that we continue to work together to strengthen Social Security for our children and grandchildren.

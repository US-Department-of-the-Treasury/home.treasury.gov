Washington,
DC—U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement regarding the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development’s (OECD) report on taxation of the digital economy.
“The U.S. firmly opposes proposals by any country to single out digital companies. Some of these companies are among the greatest contributors to U.S. job creation and economic growth.  Imposing new and redundant tax burdens would inhibit growth and ultimately harm workers and consumers.  I fully support international cooperation to address broader tax challenges arising from the modern economy and to put the international tax system on a more sustainable footing.”

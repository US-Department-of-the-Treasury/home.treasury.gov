President George W. Bush announced increased efforts to help end the violence and genocide in Darfur and bring peace to this troubled part of the world. As part of this effort, the Treasury Department blocked the assets of two high-ranking Sudanese government officials and a rebel leader for their roles in fomenting violence and human rights abuses in Darfur. Even in the face of sanctions, these individuals have continued to play direct roles in the terrible atrocities of Darfur, said Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. We are working to call attention to their horrific acts and further isolate them from the international community. The Treasury Department also acted today to sanction 30 Sudanese companies owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan, and one company that has violated the arms embargo in Darfur.

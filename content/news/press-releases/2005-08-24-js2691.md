U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral will be in Oakland this week to discuss President Bush's efforts to strengthen and preserve Social Security. The Treasurer will deliver remarks at the California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce's 26th Annual State Convention on Friday.Right now, we have a historic opportunity and obligation to save and strengthen the nation's retirement security system. The President's leadership, combined with our economic health, gives us this opportunity, said Treasurer Cabral. If we don't take steps now to fix Social Security, we will be placing an unfair burden on future generations of workers.

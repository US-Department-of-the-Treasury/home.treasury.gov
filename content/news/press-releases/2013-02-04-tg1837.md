[***View the Sources and Uses table  *here**](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Sources-and-Uses-Distrib-Jan-2013.pdf) ​**WASHINGTON** –The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of net marketable borrowing for the January – March and April – June 2013 quarters:

During the January – March 2013 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $331 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $30 billion.  This borrowing estimate is $11 billion lower than announced in October 2012.  The decrease in borrowing relates to the higher beginning-of-quarter cash balance partially offset by higher outlays and lower receipts. [1]

During the April – June 2013 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $103 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $60 billion.

During the October – December 2012 quarter, Treasury issued $297 billion in net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $93 billion.  In October 2012, Treasury had estimated $288 billion in net marketable borrowing and assumed an end-of-December cash balance of $60 billion.  The increase in the cash balance was driven primarily by higher receipts and lower outlays.

The Treasury Department supports the decision of the stock markets to remain closed tomorrow. While the nation's financial infrastructure is strong and intact, concerns remain regarding limited access to the financial district in lower Manhattan due to rescue operations currently underway. This is the wisest course of action at this time.

We expect the stock markets to open as soon as it is practical and appropriate. America's financial system is resilient. The Treasury Department also commends the remarkable efforts of everyone involved under extraordinary circumstances. The nation's business will continue and will not succumb to fear. Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families of the victims in both Washington and New York.

The Treasury Department welcomes the news that the bond market will resume trading tomorrow.

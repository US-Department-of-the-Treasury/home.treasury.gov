Experts from the People's Republic of China and the United States of America met at the Department of the Treasury in Washington, DC from May 29th to the 31st to exchange views on how to prevent and combat terrorist financing. The experts, representing various agencies and departments in both countries, also visited and were briefed at the FBI's Financial Review Group, Treasury's Operation Green Quest, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Center (FINCEN).

The present meeting is the first of semi-annual meetings planned to deal with the issue of terrorist financing. The U.S. and China will alternate serving as hosts of future meetings. These meetings will not only strengthen cooperation between China and the U.S. in the area of terrorist financing, but will also seek to further strengthen the existing cooperative relationship in the law enforcement and counter-terrorism areas between the two countries. The meetings this week represent another important step in our bilateral relationship with China and in the international fight against global terrorism.

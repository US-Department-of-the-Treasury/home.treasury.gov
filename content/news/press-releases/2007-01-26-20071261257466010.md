The U.S. Department of the Treasury today moved to designate two South African individuals, Farhad Ahmed Dockrat and Junaid Ismail Dockrat, and a related entity for financing and facilitating al Qaida, pursuant to Executive Order 13224. This action freezes any assets the designees have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits transactions between U.S. persons and the designees. Today's action targets two family members that have supported al Qaida – one by providing funds to Al Akhtar Trust, a globally-recognized al Qaida fundraiser, and another by facilitating travel for individuals to train in al Qaida camps, said Adam Szubin, Director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

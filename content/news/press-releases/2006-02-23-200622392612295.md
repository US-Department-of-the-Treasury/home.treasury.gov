Treasury Secretary John Snow is in Memphis, Tennessee today, visiting a solar panel manufacturer and discussing the President's vision for energy. Solar energy is one of the many alternative energy sources that President Bush would like to see developed and used more in the coming years as we seek to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, Snow said. He went on to speak about the President's commitment to developing alternative energy resources, such as innovative technologies that can harness the energy of the sun.

The fourth meeting of the Argentina-United States Dialogue on Illicit Finance (AUDIF) was held on May 30-31, 2018 in Washington, D.C.  The main objective of this initiative is to identify and share information on money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit finance threats and typologies. The AUDIF further serves as a forum to develop joint strategies and initiatives to combat these financial crimes and discuss issues of mutual interest.

The most recent Dialogue covered initiatives related to terrorist financing typologies and risk; identification and action against the proceeds of corruption; and the forging of a common approach towards regional illicit finance threats and vulnerabilities, including combating Venezuelan corruption.

For the United States, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Deputy Assistant Secretary Jennifer Fowler co-chaired the Dialogue along with the Republic of Argentina Financial Intelligence Unit President Mariano Federici.  The attendees included U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Director Kenneth A. Blanco, and representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Central Bank of Argentina, the Argentine National Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Bank of the Argentine Nation.

Today’s Purchasing Managers’ Index report suggests progress in manufacturing. December’s index was above the breakeven 50 level for the sixth straight month and at the highest level in twenty years. The new orders index posted the strongest showing in over fifty years. The report also suggests a better employment picture -- further evidence the President’s initiatives are creating economic growth and boosting job creation. However, there is more to be done and this Administration will continue its efforts until every American looking for work can find a job.

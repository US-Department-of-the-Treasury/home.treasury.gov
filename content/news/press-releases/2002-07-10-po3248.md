I welcomed the opportunity to have a full discussion of the economic situation and policy strategy in Brazil. I remain convinced that Governor Fraga and the Brazilian Government are pursuing sound, forward-looking policies that lay the basis for economic and financial stability. We are in full support of their efforts and intentions.

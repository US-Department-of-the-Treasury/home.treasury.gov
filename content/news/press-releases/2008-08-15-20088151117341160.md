The Treasury Department held a day-long roundtable Friday with Arab and Muslim-American organizations and charity groups to discuss issues related to charitible giving to high risk areas. Discussion topics included: the nature of the threat of terrorist abuse of charities, good governance and best practices for charities and guidance for donors. The Treasury Department continues to engage with both the charitable sector and affected communities to advance our shared interests in a free, open, tolerant, and charitable society. One that encourages charitable and humanitarian activities, while at the same time protecting those efforts from abuse, said Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing Patrick O'Brien.

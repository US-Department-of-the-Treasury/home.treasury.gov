Secretary Paulson testified today before the Senate Finance Committee with Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy Eric Solomon, and IRS Commissioner Mark Everson on ways to reduce the tax gap. The tax gap is the difference between the amount of taxes paid and the amount of taxes owed. Included in President Bush's FY 2008 budget proposal were 16 legislative proposals, as well as increased IRS funding to help increase compliance and reduce the tax gap.

WASHINGTON- Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement on the passing of Secretary Madeleine Albright:
I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend, Madeleine Albright. She lived a remarkable life of public service with an unwavering commitment to our democracy and its values. And she was an inspiration to so many who served alongside her in government, including me.
She was the first and only woman in many of the rooms where decisions were made. But she wasn’t the last. And I think that’s a credit to Madeleine’s candor, preparedness, and deep expertise, which was invaluable to leaders around the world. She will be greatly missed.

We, the G-7 Ministers of Finance and Central Bank Governors, condemn the appalling terrorist attacks carried out in the United States on Sept. 11. Our condolences go out to those who have suffered and lost loved ones as a result of these cowardly actions.

We are committed to ensuring that this tragedy will not be compounded by disruption to the global economy. Our central banks have indicated that they will provide liquidity to ensure that financial markets operate in an orderly fashion.

We will monitor economic developments and financial markets closely and stand ready to take further action as necessary.

Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill will travel to four cities in three states next week to promote President Bush's economic agenda.  During visits Monday, October 6 and Tuesday, October 7, to cities in Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma the Secretary will meet with employers and workers to hear about local economic conditions and will discuss President Bush's efforts to strengthen the economic recovery, from cutting taxes last year and enacting a stimulus package this spring to advancing free trade now that the President has trade promotion authority and repeating the President's call on Congress to enact terrorism risk insurance and pension security.The Secretary’s objective is to meet with people on the front lines of the American economy -small business owners, employees, individual investors, business leaders, economists and farmers - to discuss where our economy stands, the impact of the policies we have put in place, and the steps we are taking as we move forward. While on this tour, the Secretary will meet with local employers and visit local businesses where he will speak to employees.

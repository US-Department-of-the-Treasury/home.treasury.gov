An opinion-editorial column co-authored by three Bush Cabinet Memberes, including Treasury Secretary John Snow, appeared in theNew York Timesthis week. Our traditional defined benefit pension system is in crisis, and as a result the retirement security of millions of American workers, retirees and their families is at risk. Too many companies have recently defaulted on their pension promises, making it painfully clear that our pension laws simply don't work. The Bush administration believes that real reform must not be put off any longer.

I'm grateful the Senate acted today to put in place at Treasury a team of superb individuals to carry out the critical issues before the Department. Priorities ranging from preserving and strengthening Social Security for future generations, to reforming the tax code, to disrupting the financial underpinnings of terrorist networks and other national security threats, are critical to keeping our country on the current upward path of economic growth and job creation. I look forward to working with them to ensure economic security and prosperity for the American people, and I commend the tremendous staff at the Treasury Department for their hard work over the past months.

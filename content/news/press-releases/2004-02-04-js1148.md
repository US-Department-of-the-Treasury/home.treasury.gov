Reports out today suggest economic activity continues to gain momentum. An index of non-manufacturing business activity jumped in January to its highest level on record. On the manufacturing front, factory orders rose in December to reach the highest level in three years suggesting we'll see further pickup in production. An index of manufacturing activity released earlier this week is at a twenty-year high.

These are encouraging signs which indicate the economy's fundamentals are strong. But there is more to be done, and this Administration will continue its efforts to strengthen the economy and boost job creation until every American looking for work can find a job.

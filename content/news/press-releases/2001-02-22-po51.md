We are pleased to congratulate Mr. Lennart Bage of Sweden on his appointment today as the new President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), an international institution that finances agricultural development projects for the rural poor in developing nations. The United States strongly supported Mr. Bage's candidacy, and we view his appointment as very positive for the future of the institution. We look forward to our continued participation in IFAD under his highly capable leadership.

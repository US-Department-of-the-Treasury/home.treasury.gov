   Secretary Snow Applauds Confirmation of Officials to Fight War on Terrorist Finance

The Treasury's efforts to block terrorist dollars were bolstered on Wednesday night when the U.S. Senate confirmed Stuart Levey and Juan Zarate to lead Treasury's new Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI). Levey will serve as TFI's new Under Secretary and Zarate will serve as TFI's Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing.

Since Sept. 11, the Bush Administration's efforts have led to the designation of 383 individuals and entities as terrorists or terrorist facilitators and the freezing of nearly $142 million in terrorist-related assets, said the Secretary. But the battle is not over. I welcome Stuart and Juan to the job and am confident they will meet this challenge with determination and vigor.

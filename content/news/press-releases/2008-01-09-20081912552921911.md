Treasury today released the third in a series of briefs on Social Security. This one, entitled Social Security Reform: Benchmarks for Assessing Fairness and Benefit Adequacy, focuses on ways to assess the fairness of potential reforms and the adequacy of benefits in a financially sustainable Social Security system. The brief provides a practical illustration of how to gauge the implications of a potential reform plan along these important dimensions.

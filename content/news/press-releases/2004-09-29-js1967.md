Today's upward revision to GDP growth in the second quarter is good news for the U.S. economy and American families. The President's economic leadership has contributed to one of the strongest years of growth in 20 years. The President will push forward with pro-growth policies to keep the U.S. on track for continued economic progress and job creation. The revision underscores the fact that the fundamentals of the economy are solid and we are in a period of rising prosperity and strong growth.

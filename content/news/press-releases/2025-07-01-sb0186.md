WASHINGTON – U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent issued the following statement upon passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act in the Senate:
“Today’s Senate vote is a major step forward in enacting President Trump’s agenda to revitalize the American economy and provide certainty to households and businesses alike. Senate Republicans have taken decisive action to prevent a $4 trillion tax hike on hardworking Americans, while securing No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, new tax cuts for seniors, and vital provisions for the manufacturing sector.
“I appreciate the tireless work of Leader Thune and Chairman Crapo to usher this legislation through the Senate and closer to the President’s desk. We encourage House Republicans to act quickly so that we can deliver on President Trump’s promises to power the future of our economy and ensure the United States remains the world’s premier destination for capital and innovation.”

Treasury Secretary John Snow attended a White House signing ceremony today for the renewal of the U.S.A. Patriot Act. He said that The President's signature today on the renewal of the U.S.A. Patriot Act enables us to continue to fight the war on terror with the tools necessary to do the job. At the Treasury Department, the Patriot Act has significantly advanced the financial war on terror. Because while hatred fuels the terrorist agenda, it is money that makes it possible for them to carry out their ruthless acts. The Patriot Act has greatly advanced the ability of the Treasury, working with businesses and the people of this great nation, to restrict the flow of terrorist blood money. Its renewal is good news for Americans, bad news for those who seek to harm us.

The Treasury Department today announced that the bilateral income tax treaty with Slovenia entered into force on June 22, 2001, upon the exchange of instruments of ratification in Washington. The treaty, to which the U.S. Senate gave advice and consent to ratification in 1999, represents a new treaty relationship for the United States.



The treaty applies, with respect to taxes withheld at source, in respect of amounts paid or credited on or after September 1, 2001, and, with regard to other taxes, in respect of taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2002.

Statement of Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill

I want to thank the committee for its prompt action on the heels of House passage of TPA. It's crucial that the Senate act quickly to give the President the authority he needs to expand global markets, creating jobs here at home and sowing the seeds of opportunity in developing nations around the world.

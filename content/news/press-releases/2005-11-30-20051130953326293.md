"Economic growth was outstanding in the third quarter of this year," Treasury Secretary John Snow said in a statement this morning. "The government's estimate of the rate of growth increased to 4.3 percent, which is very good news for American workers and those seeking jobs. Additionally, it is good news for federal and state government budgets with economic growth inevitably leading to higher tax receipts. Continued strong GDP growth, along with news of a rebound in consumer confidence in November and a robust start to the holiday shopping season are all compelling indications that the American economy is solidly on a track of healthy growth."

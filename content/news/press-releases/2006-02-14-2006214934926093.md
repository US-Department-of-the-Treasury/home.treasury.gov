Assistant Secretary for International Affairs Clay Lowery was in Seattle, Washington yesterday to speak to the National Center for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. In his remarks he noted that: The rest of the country is coming to realize what the Pacific coast has long known, our economic relationship with Asia is critical to our economic strength and prosperity. As competition from Asia increases, it is all the more important that America implements the right policies here at home.  Turning to isolationism and retreating behind protectionist trade barriers is not the answer.

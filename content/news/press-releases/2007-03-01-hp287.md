The Treasury Department welcomes the British Government's launch yesterday of The Financial Challenge to Crime and Terrorism, a strategic approach to combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We applaud this important announcement by the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Ed Balls, and Home Office Minister, Tony McNulty.



As British Chancellor Gordon Brown noted in a landmark speech on February 13, 2006, one of the most important responsibilities of Finance Ministries worldwide is to detect, disrupt, and dismantle the dangerous activities of terrorists and their supporters in the global financial system.



We applaud this action by the British Government and look forward to working together to advance our common interests, including at the United Nations and through the Financial Action Task Force, whose Presidency the UK will assume in June 2007.

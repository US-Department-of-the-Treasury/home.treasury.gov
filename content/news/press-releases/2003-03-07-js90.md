Today's news underscores the importance of swiftly enacting President Bush's jobs and growth plan which will give our economy a much needed boost and help Americans find work.  According to this Administrations analysis, our economy will add about 1.4 million new jobs under this plan by the end of next year thats the best kind of help to a lot of families, who really need it.  During my confirmation hearing, I stated clearly that I will not be content until everyone who wants to work can find a good job.  Jobs give people dignity and provide hope.  I know what its like to need a job and I also know what it takes to create jobs.   Congressional passage of President Bush's legislation is my number one priority and todays news underscores the need for us to act now.

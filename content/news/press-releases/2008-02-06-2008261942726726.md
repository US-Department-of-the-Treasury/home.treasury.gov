Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. joined Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Leader John Boehner recently to announce a bipartisan agreement on an economic growth package. This agreement includes short-term incentives to bolster business investment and consumer spending to keep our economy growing and creating jobs this year. We are working with Congress to quickly enact balanced, bipartisan legislation that will provide immediate rebate payments for working families and incentives for businesses to invest and hire, said Paulson. With timely action, the House economic growth bill would help create more than half a million jobs by the end of 2008. That means even more opportunities for hard-working Americans.

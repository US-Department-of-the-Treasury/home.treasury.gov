“Assistant Secretary Ressel has served a key role in President George W. Bush’s administration. Her involvement in the establishment of a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – the largest reorganization of Federal Government in half a century – was particularly noteworthy.

“The creation of DHS was a big job for our department, since it involved so many of the Treasury Department’s agencies. Assistant Secretary Ressel worked hard to make that transition a smooth one for everyone involved.  Additionally, her work has helped Treasury’s financial management performance continue to lead government, and she helped Treasury complete an outstanding FY2003 financial closure.  She departs with the sincere gratitude and best wishes of all of her colleagues here at Treasury.”

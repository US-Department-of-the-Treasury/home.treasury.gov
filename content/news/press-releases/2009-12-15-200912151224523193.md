Embarking on a new partnership between the agencies, U.S. Department of the Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Department of Education Secretary Arne Duncan met with students, educators and community leaders to promote strengthened financial capability among the nation's youth. They outlined the first step in this effort, the National Financial Capability Challenge, a national award program that aims to encourage financial education in schools across the country and recognize high-performing teachers, students, and schools.

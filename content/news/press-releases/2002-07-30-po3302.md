The U.S. government is in close consultation with the Uruguayan authorities and the International Monetary Fund regarding a comprehensive solution to the recent economic difficulties.



In furtherance of that solution, the U.S. government stands ready to support additional assistance for Uruguay from the IMF and other international financial institutions.



Uruguay has been a strong performer in Latin America and deserves the ongoing support of the international financial community for its commitment to sound economic policy.

The United States and the United Kingdom have scheduled negotiations of a revision to their estate and gift tax treaty. The negotiations are scheduled to be held in London this spring. The revision would modify the treaty currently in force between the two countries, which has been in effect since 1979. The two Governments have decided that the current treaty needs to be updated to take into account developments in both countries tax systems and policies.

The Treasury Department invites written comments from the public regarding the upcoming negotiations. Comments on the proposed treaty revision should be sent to Philip R. West, International Tax Counsel, Room 1000 Main Treasury, Washington, DC 20220, with a copy to Patricia A. Brown, Deputy International Tax Counsel, Room 4224 Main Treasury, Washington, DC 20220. Comments may also be sent by fax to (202) 622-0646, or by e-mail to Phil.West@treasury.gov, with a copy to Patricia.A.Brown@treasury.gov.

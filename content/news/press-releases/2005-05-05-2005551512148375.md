Secretary John Snow today will take to the radio airwaves to discuss the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve Social Security. He will be interviewed by Michael Medved at 4:06 pm EDT on Salem Radio Network and by Jerry Bowyer at 4:45 pm EDT on WPTT-AM of Pittsburgh, PA. The President will continue to work with Congress to find a solution to Social Security that is sensible, permanent and fair, said the Secretary. Social Security is too important to pass this problem on to the next generation.

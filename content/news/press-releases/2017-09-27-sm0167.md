Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today after President Donald J. Trump’s speech on tax reform in Indianapolis, Indiana:
“Today President Donald J. Trump shared how middle-income families will win when we cut their taxes, and make American businesses competitive again.  The President outlined a framework with Congress that will create a simpler and fairer tax code that fuels job creation, higher wages, and economic growth, and will lead to the lowest marginal income tax rate for small and mid-size businesses in more than 80 years.  Indiana is a great example of how tax relief and reforms like these can lead to record-high employment, more investment in education and innovation, and more manufacturing right here in America.  Democrats and Republicans have a historic opportunity to work together to pass meaningful legislation that, as the President stated, will begin the ‘Middle Class Miracle.’  With the President’s leadership, we will create a level playing field so that American businesses and workers will be in a position to succeed in our global economy.”

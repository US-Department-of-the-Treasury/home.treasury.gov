President Clinton's Southwest Border Task Force announced it would begin selecting communities from each of the four border states to serve as demonstration projects for a comprehensive approach to economic development, involving close coordination at the federal, state, and local level.

The Southwest Border region, stretching from the Gulf of Mexico in Texas, across New Mexico and Arizona, and continuing through California to the Pacific Ocean, remains severely distressed, despite the tremendous new opportunities brought about by the recent strength of the nation's economy.

The Interagency Task Force on the Economic Development of the Southwest Border, formed last May by the President's Executive Order 13122, is designed to coordinate and better leverage existing Administration efforts aimed at the economic development of the Southwest Border, in concert with locally led efforts. Chaired by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, its mission is to search for, analyze, coordinate and present workable solutions and policy options for improving the standard of living and overall economic conditions of the border region.

The Task Force is comprised of the President's entire Cabinet, as well as other key federal agencies, and reports to the Vice President in his role as head of the Community Empowerment Board. The first Annual Report of the Task Force, to be released next month, will include recommendations for specific actions and development of a policy plan.

Communities and community-based organizations within 150 miles of the southwest border are eligible to apply for selection to the pilot program until May 15. Applications for the pilot program and additional information on the Task Force can be found on the Treasury Department web site at http://www.ustreas.gov/sw_border/.

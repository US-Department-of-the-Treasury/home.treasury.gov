Today's report on GDP growth shows an economy growing at a steady pace. GDP growth over the past two quarters demonstrates the economic progress made by millions of American families and businesses. Consumer confidence is at a two-year high and home sales continue to be very strong. Over the past ten months, 1.5 million new jobs have been created and unemployment rates are down across the board. This is all further evidence that the economic growth and job creation ignited by the President's tax cuts will continue on its current upward path.

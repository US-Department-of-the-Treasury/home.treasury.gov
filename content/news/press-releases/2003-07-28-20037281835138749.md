Treasury Secretary John Snow, Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao are in Wisconsin on Tuesday discussing the state of the economy and the recently enacted jobs and growth plan - as well as other efforts by President Bush to create jobs, strengthen the economic recovery and increase workers' standards of living.



Among other stops, on Tuesday the three cobinet members will meet with employees of the Harley Davidson plant in Milwaukee.  On Wednesday, the Economic Team will be in Minnesota.  More than 1.7 million taxpayers in Minnesota, and another 1.8 million taxpayers in Wisconsin, will have lower income tax bills in 2003 as a result of President Bush's Jobs and Growth Act.

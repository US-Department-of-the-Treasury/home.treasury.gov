Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill today announced that Pam Olson has joined the Department of the Treasury as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy.



Pam brings incredible tax code expertise to the Treasury, said O'Neill. The President is determined that we cut taxes for every American quickly. Pam's experience means she's ready to hit the ground running. And that makes her a valuable asset to every American eagerly awaiting tax relief.

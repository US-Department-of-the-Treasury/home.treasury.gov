​**View the Sources and Uses Table here Washington, D.C.  --**The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of net marketable borrowing for the April – June 2016 and July – September 2016 quarters:

 
- During the April – June 2016 quarter, Treasury expects to pay down $65 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $350 billion.This pay down estimate is $47 billion lower than announced in February 2016.The increase in borrowing is due primarily to lower receipts and higher outlays, partially offset by higher net issuances of State and Local Government Series securities.
 
- During the July – September 2016 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $155 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $300 billion.
  During the January – March 2016 quarter, Treasury issued $244 billion in net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $314 billion.  In February 2016, Treasury estimated $250 billion in net marketable debt and assumed an end-of-March cash balance of $320 billion.  The modest net decrease in borrowing was driven by a decrease in the end-of-quarter cash balance.[1]   Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 4, 2016.   ###

**WASHINGTON**- The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the following statement from Secretary Tim Geithner on passage of financial reform legislation by the U.S. House of Representatives:



We congratulate the House of Representatives on passing historic financial reform and commend Chairman Frank and Chairman Peterson for their leadership throughout this process.  This is a strong bill. It will provide essential protections for consumers and investors and help make sure the financial system meets the credit needs of Main Street America. With action by the Senate, we will be able to turn our attention to putting these protections in place.

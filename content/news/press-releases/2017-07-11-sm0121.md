U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin today met with representatives of the National United Committee to Protect Pensions (NUCPP). The meeting included 30 NUCPP participants from 15 states.

During the meeting, the Secretary listened to the NUCPP’s concerns about funding issues their members are facing and options to address these concerns were discussed.  While the Secretary  underscored that the funding problems that NUCPP and other multiemployer pension plans are facing requires Congressional action, he stated his commitment to working with Congress on the issue.

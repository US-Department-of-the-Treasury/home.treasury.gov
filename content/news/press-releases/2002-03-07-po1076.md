Today the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service released temporary and proposed regulations replacing the loss disallowance rules, a portion of which was invalidated by the Federal Circuit in*Rite Aid Corp. v. United States*, 255 F.3d 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In*Rite Aid*, the Federal Circuit held that the duplicated loss rule of Regulation Section 1.1502-20, which disallows certain losses on sales of stock of a member of a consolidated group, was an invalid exercise of regulatory authority.



The regulations addressed by the Court in*Rite Aid*were developed over a period of years and reflected extensive consideration of a number of complex issues and factual situations. The regulations published today are merely a stop-gap measure to provide interim guidance while we develop a new set of rules, stated Mark Weinberger, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy.



Treasury and the IRS are devoting substantial resources to the development of a comprehensive regime to replace the rules at issue in*Rite Aid. *In light of the complexity of the issues, Treasury and the IRS are soliciting comments.

*The text of the regulations is available from the IRS.*

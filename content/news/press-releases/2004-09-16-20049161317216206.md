Secretary John W. Snow is in Cincinnati today to tour a local business and meet with business leaders on the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. More than 4.4 million Ohio taxpayers will have lower income tax bills in 2004, thanks to the President's tax cuts, he said. We still have more work to do. But with the right economic policies, with a dedication to getting government out of your way and giving you fairness and freedom, I am optimistic that our best economic days are ahead of us.

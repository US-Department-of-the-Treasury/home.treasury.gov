**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today identified three companies owned by the Government of Libya as subject to sanctions pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13566.   E.O. 13566 blocks all property and interests in property of the Government of Libya and its agencies, instrumentalities and controlled entities within U.S. jurisdiction, whether specifically identified by OFAC or not.  U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in business with any Libyan state-owned entity. Today’s identifications are intended to aid U.S. persons and others in meeting their obligations under E.O. 13566.   “The United Nations and countries around the world are locking down the Government of Libya’s assets to prevent the Qaddhafi regime from sponsoring further bloodshed,” said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. “Today’s identifications name additional agencies of the Qaddhafi regime; all of their assets should be frozen.”   The following entities were identified by OFAC today as subject to sanctions pursuant to E.O. 13566:
- **Libyan Jamahiriya Broadcasting Corporation:** Libya’s state broadcasting company, which owns several radio and television stations in Libya.
- **Dalia Advisory Ltd.:** a London-based investment firm that is 100 percent owned by the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), which was identified by OFAC as a Government of Libya entity on  March 15, 2011.
- **Lafico Algeria Holdings:** an Algeria-based subsidiary of the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company (LAFICO), which was identified by OFAC as a Government of Libya entity on March 15, 2011.​

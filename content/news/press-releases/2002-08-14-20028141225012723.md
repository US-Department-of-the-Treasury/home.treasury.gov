On the heels of the President's Economic forum in Waco, Texas, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill will travel to three Western States to discuss the economy.  During visits this week to Portland, OR, Seattle, WA, and Denver, CO, the Secretary will meet with employers and workers to hear about local economic conditions and will discuss President Bush's efforts to strengthen the economic recovery, from cutting taxes last year and enacting a stimulus package this spring to advancing free trade now that the President has trade promotion authority and repeating the President's call on Congress to enact terrorism risk insurance and pension security.  This trip is one of several the Secretary has made and will continue to make throughout the fall to gauge economic growth in localities across the nation and discuss the President's agenda to strengthen the economic recovery and create jobs.

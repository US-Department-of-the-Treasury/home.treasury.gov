*“The President’s Budget sets a course to put our nation on sound fiscal footing, while making the necessary, targeted investments to support the middle class, level the playing field for American businesses, create more fairness in our tax code, and lay the groundwork for long-term growth for our country,” said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew.*
 
The President’s 2015 Budget recognizes that while we have made significant progress in our economic recovery, there is still more work to be done. It provides a roadmap to continue building on this progress by eliminating unfair tax loopholes, supporting opportunities for our middle class, leveling the playing field for American businesses and encouraging investments to maintain U.S. economic competitiveness. 
 
Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released a key document that points the way toward meeting these challenges – the General Explanations of the Administration's FY2015 Revenue Proposals, or “Greenbook,” which explains the Administration’s revenue proposals included in the Budget.
 
The FY2015 Greenbook includes key policies to:
·         Expand Earned Income Tax Credit benefits for workers without qualifying children, families with more than two children and married couples;
·         Level the playing field by modernizing U.S. tax rules so that multinational firms pay their fair share;
·         Close loopholes that allow professional services businesses to avoid self-employment payroll taxes; and
·         Support students by excluding Pell grants from income and from education tax credit calculations.
 
**Other proposals from the Budget:**

·         Increasing the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit available to working families with young children;

Ask the Wealthiest Americans to Contribute their Fair Share to Balanced Deficit Reduction by:

Close Unfair Tax Loopholes by:
·         Taxing carried interest profits as ordinary income;
·         Eliminating a depreciation benefit for corporate jets;
·         Imposing a financial crisis responsibility fee; and
·         Modifying like-kind exchange rules for real property.
 
Promote Growth and Innovation while Supporting Job Creation at Home, as Part of a Reserve for Business Tax Reform by:
·         Enhancing the research and experimentation credit and making it permanent;
·         Establishing tax incentives for locating jobs and business activity in the U.S. and prohibiting tax deductions for shipping jobs overseas; and
·         Increasing and consolidating the amount of deductible new business expenditures for small businesses.

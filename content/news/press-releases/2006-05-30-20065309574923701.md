In a statement yesterday morning, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow announced his resignation and expressed his confidence in the President's nominee to replace him: Goldman Sachs chairman Henry Paulson. It has been a great honor to serve as the 73rd Secretary of the Treasury and I will always be grateful to you for the opportunity you gave me, the Secretary told the President. But as you know I have looked forward for some time to returning to private life.  I do so with a great sense of satisfaction in what has been accomplished over the last 3-1/2 years.

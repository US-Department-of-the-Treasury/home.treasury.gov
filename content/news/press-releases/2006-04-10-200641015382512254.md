Speaking to and visiting with seniors at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago, Illinois this morning, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Mark J. Warshawsky discussed how the President's Medicare prescription drug benefit is helping seniors and Americans with disabilities receive the drugs they need at reduced costs. Everyone with Medicare is eligible, Warshawsky explained. It really is important for Medicare beneficiaries to enroll now – the sooner they enroll, the sooner they can start saving. Average beneficiaries can save more than 50 percent of their annual drug costs, and those with especially high prescription costs will receive extra coverage.

Taking advantage of the scheduled IMF World Bank spring meetings, we discussed the recent breach of the bilateral agreement on exchange of financial information.

We agree that information sharing between the United States and Mexico is very important to combating money laundering, terrorism and organized crime.

We agree that this matter needs to be addressed immediately and we pledge to work together to resume this important exchange of information as soon as possible.

I welcome the passage of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act by the House of Representatives. This bill marks an important step forward in our continuing efforts to reform the IRS, which the Administration intensified two years ago. The American taxpayer will be better served by the additional rights, expanded electronic filing, better customer service and oversight measures laid out in this legislation.

I urge the Senate to pass the Senate version of this bill as soon as possible, so that we can move forward in creating a better managed, more customer-friendly IRS.

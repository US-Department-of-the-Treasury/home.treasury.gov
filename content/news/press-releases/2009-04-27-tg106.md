**Washington, D.C. -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury**today announced its current estimates of marketable borrowing for the April - June 2009 and July – September 2009 quarters:

- During the April – June 2009 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $361 billion of marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $245 billion, which includes $200 billion for the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP).The borrowing estimate is $196 billion higher than announced in February 2009.The increase in borrowing is primarily related to a continuation of the SFP, and lower receipts and outlays.
- During the July – September quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $515 billion of marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $270 billion, which includes $200 billion for the SFP.

During the January – March 2009 quarter, Treasury borrowed $481 billion of marketable debt, finishing at the end of March with a cash balance of $269 billion, of which $200 billion was attributable to the SFP.In February, Treasury estimated $493 billion in marketable borrowing, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $225 billion.The decrease in borrowing was related to lower receipts offset by lower outlays and adjustments in the cash balance.

TG-771

**BRUSSELS** - The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the following statement from Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey on the U.S.-European Union Agreement on the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program:

We welcome the European Parliament's consent today, by a wide margin, to the revised U.S.-EU agreement on the processing and transfer of financial messaging data for the purposes of the Treasury Department's Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP).

A great deal of hard work has been put in to achieving this new agreement. We worked with our European partners over the past several months to preserve the effectiveness of this unique program and, at the same time, ensure that we will enforce the unprecedented data-privacy safeguards that were built into the program from the beginning. This new agreement does that without compromising the operation of the TFTP.

With the resumption of the full functioning of the TFTP, the U.S. and the EU will have restored this highly valuable counter-terrorism tool, which over the past decade has repeatedly provided valuable lead information that has aided in the prevention of terrorist attacks and in the investigation of many of the most visible and violent terrorist attacks around the globe.

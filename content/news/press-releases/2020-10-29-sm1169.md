WASHINGTON
–
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement regarding offsets applied by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to payments due to the Fire Department of New York (FDNY):
“For over a decade, the FDNY has been forced to shoulder the burden of debts owed by the NYC government. Since this issue was brought to my attention, I have been personally engaged in ensuring that New York’s Bravest receive everything that they are due from the U.S. government.
“The firefighters who answered the call of duty in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 deserve the nation’s total support. I am delighted that CMS has wired payments to the FDNY refunding the past offsets applied to cover unpaid NYC debts. I am also pleased that this issue has been successfully resolved, and that World Trade Center Health Program payments are now protected from future offsets.”

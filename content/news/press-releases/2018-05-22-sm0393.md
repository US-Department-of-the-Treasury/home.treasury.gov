U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today after the House of Representatives passed S.2155:
"The House of Representatives acted on a bipartisan basis today to provide relief for America’s small, midsize, community, and regional banks, while maintaining important protections for consumers and taxpayers. I would like to thank Chairmen Crapo and Hensarling for leading this legislative effort to pass critical regulatory reform for the financial sector. This legislation will lead to increased investment in communities across the United States and foster greater economic growth for our country. The reforms in this bill align with key recommendations from Treasury’s Core Principles Reports on financial regulation and will more appropriately tailor our system of financial regulation to ensure that small businesses and consumers have access to credit."

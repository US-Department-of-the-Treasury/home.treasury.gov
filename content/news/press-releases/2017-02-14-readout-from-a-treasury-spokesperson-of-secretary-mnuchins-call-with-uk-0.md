**WASHINGTON** – U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke by phone today with UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond.
 
Secretary Mnuchin discussed opportunities to work with the Chancellor to support the special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.
 
During their conversation, Secretary Mnuchin noted that this is an important period as the British government begins to outline its objectives and engage with the European Union to define a new relationship following the June 2016 referendum. The Secretary underscored his desire to strengthen the deep economic bond with Britain, including by further strengthening the commercial and financial relationship between our two countries. Secretary Mnuchin also highlighted the strong cooperation on illicit finance threats and looked forward to continuing the close collaboration on these critical issues.

Today the House of Representatives acted on a measure that is both sound fiscal policy and solid common sense. Their vote to prevent a tax increase on more than 28 million married couples is one on which the Senate should quickly follow suit. Making the marriage penalty tax relief permanent will benefit married couples of all income levels, especially those in the lower brackets. Our tax code should not penalize marriage. Hard-working married couples should be able to keep more of their own money to help pay for their children’s education, invest for retirement, and spend as they see fit.This action brings us one step closer to fairness and simplicity in our tax code.

H.R. 4181 permanently extends the increased standard deduction and the 15-percent individual income tax bracket expansion for married taxpayers filing joint returns.

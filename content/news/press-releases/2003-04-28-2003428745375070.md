After a two week recess, Congress returns to Washington, DC this week and is expected to turn to President Bush's Jobs and Growth plan.   Treasury Secretary John Snow, during meetings this week with lawmakers and a series of public appearances, will echo President Bush's message that the American  economy is not meeting its full potential and that with a robust package of at least $550 billion in across- the-board tax relief, we will help create more than a million new jobs by the end of 2004.

**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the following statement from Secretary Tim Geithner on the Senate Agriculture Committee's passage of the The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010:

Today, the Senate took another step towards comprehensive financial reform.  Under Chairman Lincoln's strong leadership, the Senate Agriculture Committee voted out a bipartisan bill that will bring derivatives trading out of the dark, provide strong oversight of market participants, and combat fraud, abuse and manipulation. Chairman Dodd's comprehensive and tough legislation has already passed out of the Senate Banking Committee. We will continue to work with Chairman Dodd, Chairman Lincoln, and Senate leadership to craft strong derivatives provisions that close loopholes, provide necessary transparency, and reduce threats to financial stability as part of a final, comprehensive financial reform bill.

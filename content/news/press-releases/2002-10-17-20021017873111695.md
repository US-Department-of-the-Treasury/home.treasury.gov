Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill is in Massachusetts today discussing President Bush's efforts to strengthen the economic recovery. O'Neill has spent a considerable amount of time traveling the country to meet with people on the front lines of the American economy -small business owners, employees, individual investors, business leaders, economists and farmers--to discuss where our economy stands, the impact of the policies we have put in place, and the steps we are taking as we move forward. Over the last few weeks, O'Neill has traveled to Washington, Oregon, Colorado, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Connecticut, Iowa and Missouri.   O'Neill will deliver remarks at the Harvard Business School at 3:00pm today;  a press availability will follow.

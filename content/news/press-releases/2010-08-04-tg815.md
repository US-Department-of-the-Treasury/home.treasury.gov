TG-815



On August 4th, in remarks co-hosted by the Center for American Progress and the American Action Forum, Secretary Geithner discussed the need to restore America to a pro-growth tax and fiscal policy. Secretary Geithner reminded the audience that over the past two decades, Washington ran an experiment in tax and fiscal policy. In the 1990's, the government put an end to budget deficits, job creation was robust, and America enjoyed a period of economic growth where prosperity was widely shared. Over the next decade, Washington tried a new path, running up huge amounts of debt, while incomes for most Americans stagnated and job creation was anemic. Today, we are still wrestling with the damage from that period. Secretary Geithner argued that we must restore America to a pro-growth tax and fiscal policy, where the middle class once again has the chance to grow and prosper and where we stop passing off bills to the next generation. Following his remarks, the Secretary engaged in conversation with John Podesta, President and CEO of Center for American Progress, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, President of the American Action Forum, and a bipartisan audience.

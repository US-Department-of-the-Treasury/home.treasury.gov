​  **WASHINGTON** – Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew spoke by phone today with Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang.  
During the conversation, Secretary Lew raised the recent shift in China’s exchange rate regime, stating that Treasury will closely monitor how it is implemented.  
Secretary Lew stated the United States has seen progress by China towards financial reform, including new commitments secured this summer at the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue to move towards a more flexible, market-determined exchange rate; limit foreign exchange intervention to disorderly market conditions; and increase the transparency of its exchange rate policies.  But, Secretary Lew emphasized that it is critical China continue with reforms which are necessary to move towards an economy driven primarily by household consumption rather than exports, which is in both China’s and America’s best interests.  
Secretary Lew underscored that the upcoming visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Washington in September will be an important opportunity to make progress on issues vital to our economic relationship. Secretary Lew also reviewed the status of the P5+1 Iran agreement and the importance that sanctions remain in effect until Iran is in full compliance.

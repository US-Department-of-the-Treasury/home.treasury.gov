I congratulate the U.S. Senate and in particularSenators Stevens, Byrd, Campbell and Kohl and the Members of the Appropriations Committee, on passage of the Treasury, General Government and Civil Service Apppropriations bill on a 99-0 vote. Today’s Senate vote will ensure that the IRS can meet itsimportant mission of ensuring a successful filing season,providing the best service to taxpayers and moving forward withplans to modernize its operations. I urge the House to vote aswell for funding the IRS needs to meet these challenges.

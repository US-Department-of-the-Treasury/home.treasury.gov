Secretary Paulson testifies today before the Senate Banking Committee. I believe that the openness of the U.S. economy to competition and our participation in international trade are key to economic growth, higher wages, and increased opportunities for U.S. workers. And I am determined to make sure that China's growth and expanding market create maximum opportunities for the United States, said Paulson

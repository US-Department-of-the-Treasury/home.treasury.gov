U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will travel to Portland, Oregon; Bozeman, Montana; and Bismarck, North Dakota on March 28-31 to discuss the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve the U.S. Social Security system.Following the release of the Social Security and Medicare Trustees' reports on March 23, Secretary Snow, the Managing Trustee of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds, said, The numbers published today leave no question that Social Security reform is needed, and it is needed soon. Reform of this system, for the sake of our children, grandchildren and the financial future of our country, is a very real and pressing matter.

The President is committed to saving Social Security and has laid out some basic principles, he said. He wants to preserve benefits for current and near-retirees while saving and strengthening the system for future generations. For future generations of retirees, the President believes an awful lot of hope lies in personal accounts – something that would allow younger workers to build a nest egg that they own and control.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with John Hope Bryant, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Operation HOPE, to mark the start of National Financial Literacy Month and advance their shared commitment to financial empowerment for all Americans.

The meeting centered on the Financial Literacy for All (FL4A) initiative—a national effort led by Bryant to embed financial education into the fabric of American life. Secretary Bessent and Mr. Bryant have known each other for nearly a decade and discussed ways to deepen collaboration between the public and private sectors to expand access to financial tools and knowledge.

“For too long, financial literacy has been treated as a luxury,” said Secretary Bessent. “It’s a necessity—just like reading and writing. John and I have been aligned on this for nearly a decade, and I’m proud to stand with him this April and beyond.”

Bessent and Bryant have worked together for years on economic opportunity efforts. Their continued collaboration reflects a shared goal: ensuring every individual, family, and business has the foundation to make informed financial decisions and build lasting security.

National Financial Literacy Month begins today, April 1. The Treasury Department will be announcing events, initiatives, and public engagement opportunities throughout the month.

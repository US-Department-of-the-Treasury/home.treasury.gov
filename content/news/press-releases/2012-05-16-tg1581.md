**WASHINGTON**– The President today signed an Executive Order (E.O.), “Blocking Property of Persons Threatening the Peace, Security, or Stability of Yemen,” providing the U.S. Department of the Treasury with a new authority to target, in consultation with the State Department, individuals and entities that pose a threat to Yemen’s peace, security, or stability, including those who are obstructing the implementation of the November 23, 2011, agreement that provides for a peaceful transition of power that meets the legitimate demands and aspirations of the Yemeni people.This authority is designed to make it clear to those individuals in Yemen who are determined to undermine the country’s ongoing democratic transition that the United States will take the steps necessary to hold them accountable for their actions.“This order gives Treasury important authorities to target those who threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen by disrupting its political transition,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “The United States will continue to stand with the Yemeni people as they take steps to realize a more secure, prosperous, and representative future.”** **Upon Treasury’s identification and listing of a designated individual or entity under this E.O., any property in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons in which the individual or entity has an interest would be blocked, and U.S. persons would be prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.The United States remains focused on working with its partners in Yemen, the region, and the international community to support a peaceful political transition in Yemen.To achieve long-term success, the Yemeni government must be free to implement the November 23, 2011, political agreement, which includes military and constitutional reform. It is essential that all Yemeni actors, including individuals from the previous government, play a constructive role in the political process.The United States will continue to monitor the situation in Yemen and Treasury stands ready to exercise the authority provided in today’s E.O. to hold accountable those persons who would obstruct Yemen’s transition.*###*​

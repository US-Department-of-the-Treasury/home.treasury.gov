**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated the Islamic National Bank (INB)of Gaza for being controlled by Hamas,aSpecially Designated Global Terrorist,and for providing financial services to Hamas members and employees, including members of the organization's military wing. Treasury also today designated Al-Aqsa Television, a television station in Gaza financed and controlled by Hamas.Today's actions, taken pursuant toExecutive Order 13224, freeze any assets INB or Al-Aqsa Television holdunder U.S. jurisdiction and prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with these parties.Executive Order 13224targets terrorists, terrorist organizations, persons owned or controlled by or acting for or on behalf of designated terrorists or terrorist organizations, and those providing financial,material, or technological support to designated terrorists or terrorist organizations, or for acts of terrorism.

Consistent with our commitment to a well-regulated and transparent financial system in the Palestinian territories, Treasury will continue to expose Hamas's efforts to create institutions with the trappings of legitimacy that are in fact controlled by and used to support a terrorist organization, said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey.

Hamas opened INB in GazaCity in April 2009 after morethan two years of planning.Lacking a legal license from the Palestinian MonetaryAuthority (PMA), Hamas officials authorizedthe opening of the institutionand provided $20 million of the initialcapital.TheINB operates outside the legitimate financial system and isnot in compliance with Palestinian Authority (PA) banking or securities regulations.ThePA, the PMA and the Palestinian Capital Market Authority have publicly declared the business illegal and have issued public warningsto citizens against doing business with INB or buying its shares.

While posing as a legitimate financial institution, INB isproviding Hamas with a means to receive and store large amounts of smuggled cash touse at the organization's discretion.In May 2009, Hamas's finance office in Gazamoved 1.1 million Euros to INB, with which it thenpaid the salaries of members of Hamas's military wing who held accounts there.Hamas has also opened thousands of accounts for its members at INB throughwhich it pays salaries.

The INB's board of directors and its senior management consist of high-ranking and prominent Hamas activists, including the chairman of the board of directors andchief executive officer, both of whom were appointed to their positions because of theirconnections with Hamas.

Also designated today is Al-Aqsa Television, a television station financed and controlled by Hamas.Al-Aqsa is a primary Hamas media outlet and airs programs and music videos designed to recruit children to become Hamas armed fighters and suicide bombers upon reaching adulthood.

Treasury will not distinguish between a business financed and controlled by a terrorist group, such as Al-Aqsa Television, and the terrorist group itself, Levey said.

Hamas leadership raised the initial capital for thestation shortly after the January 2006 Palestinian elections.At that time, donorscontributed half a million dollars for the channel, which was to be headed by members ofHamas, and shortly thereafter, Hamas leaders negotiated broadcasting arrangements with asatellite television provider.As of late 2009, the Hamas headquarters in Damascus, Syria,allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars for Al-Aqsa TV's budget, and senior Hamas officials continued to control the station's operations.

Fathi Hammad, the former director of Al-Aqsa TV, currently serves as the Hamas interiorminister in Gaza, is a formersenior member of Hamas's military wing in Gaza, and as of 2007, was a member of theHamas Shura Council.Hammad has supervised the construction of smuggling tunnels forHamas and has encouraged the building and use of homemade weapons for use againstIsrael.In May 2009, Dr. Mahmud Abu-Daf replaced Hammad as the head of Al-AqsaTV.Abu-Daf is a senior Hamas figure who served as a member of the Hamas ShuraCouncil and Political Bureau.

Hamas, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist backed by Iran, hasintentionally killed hundreds of civilians, including U.S. citizens.Its violenttakeover of Gaza in 2007 has allowed continued rocket attacks against Israeli citiesand civilians within range of the territory.As of this year, Hamas has continuedto ignore demands from the international community to renounce violence andaccept the other Quartet principles, including the recognition of Israel and acommitment to abide by past diplomatic agreements.Moreover, statements byHamas leader Khaled Mish'al indicate that the group continues to produce andsmuggle weapons into Gaza.

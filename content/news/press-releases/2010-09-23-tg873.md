**WASHINGTON**– The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the following statement from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner on final passage of the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act of 2010.



Congress took a powerful step today to continue strengthening our nation's economic recovery. This common-sense legislation to accelerate tax relief and unlock credit for small businesses will help create new jobs in local communities across our nation. President Obama championed this Small Business Jobs Bill because it will make a meaningful difference for entrepreneurs struggling to expand their businesses and put more Americans back to work. I'd like to thank Majority Leader Reid, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Senator Baucus, Senator Landrieu, Congressman Frank, Congressman Levin, and many others for their leadership in delivering this critical legislation for the American people.

Secretary O'Neill made the following statement:



Congress has agreed on a budget framework, including $1.35 trillion for tax relief. We're getting right to work on the details of how we get tax relief to the American people. We have the opportunity to cut income tax rates retroactively for all Americans, including millions of small businesses. If we act quickly, refund checks can go out the door this summer and give the economy a second wind.



Working together, we will put substantial tax relief on the President's desk by the end of this month, and in the pockets of working Americans only a few weeks later.

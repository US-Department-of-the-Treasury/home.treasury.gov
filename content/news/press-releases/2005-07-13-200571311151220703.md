The U.S Department of the Treasury today designated the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia (MIRA), a U.K.-based Saudi oppositionist organization, for providing material support to al Qaida.  MIRA is run by al Qaida-affiliated Saad al-Faqih, who was designated pursuant to E.O. 13224 by the Treasury onDecember 21, 2004and is named on the United Nations 1267 Committee consolidated list of terrorists tied to al Qaida, UBL and the Taliban. Al-Faqih uses MIRA to facilitate al Qaida's operations, said Stuart Levey, the Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).  Designating MIRA will help stem the flow of funds to the organization and put the world on notice of its support for al Qaida.

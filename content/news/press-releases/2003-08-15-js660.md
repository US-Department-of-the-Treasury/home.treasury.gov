FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

August 15, 2003JS-660

We applaud the initial response of the financial services industry, including the exchanges and their member firms, to the power outage.  The extraordinary commitment of the men and women who make our markets work have again demonstrated the resiliency and strength of the U.S. financial system.   The fact that the markets have operated so smoothly under these adverse conditions and have continued functioning in relatively normal fashion, underscores the confidence people around the world have in the U.S. financial markets.

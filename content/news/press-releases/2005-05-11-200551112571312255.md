Secretary John Snow today announced that 41 organizations have been selected to receive $2 billion in tax credit allocations under the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) Program. Today's announcement promises more jobs and a brighter future for every community where NMTCs are allocated, said Secretary Snow. By providing businesses with critical investments, job creation will be stimulated in communities that are very much in need.

I was saddened to learn of the recent passing of former House Speaker Tom Foley. Tom was a dynamic leader who was driven by a deep passion for breaking down barriers to opportunity. He was particularly committed to making sure hard working families had basic access to nutritious food. Tom fought tirelessly for all Americans, whether they lived in urban centers, on farms or along the coasts. But he never lost sight of his roots or those back home in rural Washington.

Tom had a remarkable and distinguished career of public service, and he rose to the top of his profession through merit and determination. Tom was a firm believer in using his position of influence to bring people together for the simple cause of finding solutions to real problems, and his legacy lives on in the good work and deeds of those he inspired. I send my thoughts and prayers to Tom's wife, Heather, and all those he served with such pride.

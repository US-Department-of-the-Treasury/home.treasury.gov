Secretary Henry Paulson and Mrs. Laura Bush marked the restoration and modernization of the Treasury Building with a tour of the building and a ceremonial ribbon cuttingThursday.Many of the building'smost historic features have been carefully restored and in some cases presented in ways that have not been seen since the early 1879s.This is just part of the rich history shared by the Treasury Department and the White House. It's a history we're proud of. And through the active involvement of Treasury employees, as well as public and private donors, we intend to preserve the historical integrity of our building for future generations,said Secretary Paulson.

I applaud today's efforts in the Senate to bring Social Security personal account legislation up for consideration by the full Senate.

  

Passage of this legislation sponsored by Senators DeMint, Santorum and others would be a positive first step to a strengthened Social Security system, establishing voluntary personal accounts and protecting Social Security money from being spent on other government programs.

  

The President is committed to fixing Social Security permanently so that it remains strong for our children and grandchildren.The longer we wait for legislative action to comprehensively fix Social Security, the more difficult our choices will be.

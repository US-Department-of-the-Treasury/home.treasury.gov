Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. delivered remarks on the markets and the economy last week at a Women in Housing and Finance annual meeting. We must dramatically expand our attention to the fundamental needs of our system, and move much more quickly to update our regulatory structure always keeping in mind that there must be a balance between market discipline and market oversight, said Paulson.

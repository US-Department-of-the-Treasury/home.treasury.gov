"President Trump forcefully outlined a path forward for sovereign nations across the globe to unite and address the grave threats posed by rogue regimes while at the same time advancing the vital interests of their own people. The President made it clear that the United States will not allow oppressive rulers in Iran or North Korea to hold the world hostage while they work to proliferate weapons of mass destruction. We will engage with our colleagues at the U.N. and ensure that this important alliance takes concrete steps to promote security, prosperity and peace."

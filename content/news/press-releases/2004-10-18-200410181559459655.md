Treasury Secretary John Snow will visit the Lancaster, Pennsylvania area on Tuesday to meet with local business leaders and students to discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. As a result of the President's economic leadership, we have overcome a recession and seen 13 straight months of job creation, totaling more than 1.9 million new U.S. jobs since August 2003, said Secretary Snow. Pennsylvania has gained new jobs this year, and the President's tax reform policies have ensured that more than 4.6 million Pennsylvania taxpayers will have lower income tax bills in 2004.

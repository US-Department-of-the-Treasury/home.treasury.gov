**** In Africa earlier this year, Secretary O'Neill highlighted the need for people in poor countries to have access to clean, safe water.  At the Global Millennium Water Initiative Symposium today in Houston, Secretary O'Neill again the issue and the need for delivering on the promise of clean water:  Today, 45% of sub-Saharan Africans lack access to clean, safe water.  That’s about 300 million people - more than the population of the United States.  The situation is just about as grave in many parts of Asia and Latin America. I have found that people are inspired by great goals.  A great goal would be for all of the people to have clean water - and soon.

The findings from an annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2005 are released today and posted on the U.S. Treasury web site (
http://www.treas.gov/tic/fpis.shtml#usclaims
).
The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
Future surveys are scheduled to be carried out annually.
The next report will present results from the survey for year-end 2006.
A complementary survey measuring foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities is also carried out annually.
Preliminary results from the most recent such survey, covering securities held as of June 30, 2006, are expected to be reported by March 30, 2007.
Overall Results
The survey measured the value of U.S. holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2005 of approximately $4,609 billion, with $3,318 billion held in foreign equities, $1,028 billion in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $263 billion in foreign short-term debt securities.
The previous survey measured U.S. holdings at year-end 2004 of approximately $3,787 billion, with $2,560 billion held in foreign equities, $993 billion in foreign long-term debt securities, and $233 billion in foreign short-term debt securities (see Table 1).
U.S. holdings by country at the end of 2005 were by far the largest for the United Kingdom ($815 billion), followed by Japan ($531 billion) and Canada ($419 billion) (see Table 2).
The surveys are part of an internationally-coordinated effort under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to improve the measurement of portfolio asset holdings.

WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) released a [request for information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/30/2025-09766/request-for-information-related-to-the-executive-order-modernizing-payments-to-and-from-americas?utm_campaign=subscription+mailing+list&utm_medium=email&utm_source=federalregister.gov) related to the Executive Order (EO) 14247 “Modernizing Payments To and From America’s Bank Account,” which transitions federal disbursements to electronic payments.  Beginning September 30, 2025, all federal payments that are currently made by paper check—including Social Security benefits, tax refunds, and vendor payments—will be made electronically.

Paper checks are increasingly the front door for fraud. Treasury is committed to raising awareness of the growing fraud risks associated with paper checks and providing Americans with the knowledge and tools to fight financial fraud and make informed financial decisions.

The request for information (RFI) released today offers the opportunity for interested individuals and organizations to provide feedback on Treasury’s implementation of the Executive Order and make recommendations to increase public awareness to help consumers, including unbanked and underbanked populations, transition to digital payments.

Members of the public are encouraged to submit comments within 30 days. Comments responding to this request for information will be publicly viewable at [www.regulations.gov](http://www.regulations.gov).

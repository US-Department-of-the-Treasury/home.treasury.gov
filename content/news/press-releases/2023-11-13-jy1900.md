As Prepared for Delivery
Treasurer Chalmers, thank you for joining us here in San Francisco for the APEC Finance Ministerial and APEC Economic Leaders’ Week.
We continue to strengthen bilateral relations between our nations. This meeting follows a very successful State Visit by Prime Minister Albanese last month in which he and President Biden helped inaugurate a new era of U.S-Australia strategic cooperation.
As the President said during Prime Minister Albanese's visit last month, the alliance between Australia and the United States has never been more important than it is today. And the U.S. has never been more committed than we are today.
I am especially excited to meet during APEC Economic Leaders’ Week as Australia is a strong partner of the United States in this important forum. I would like to thank you for your collaboration on our policy priorities this year, particularly on sustainable finance and modern supply side economics.
I am happy to continue our discussion today to promote close cooperation on our shared economic objectives.
Thank you.

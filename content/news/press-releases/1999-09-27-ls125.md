FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-125

We welcome the announcement by the IMF management and the Government of Colombia that they have reached understanding on all of the key elements and policies for a three-year $2.7 billion program and the announcement by the Inter-American Development Bank and World Bank of additional support. Colombia's implementation of this economic program should help lay the basis for sustained economic growth and financial stability. We also welcome Colombia's commitment to strengthen the social safety net in context of its three year program.

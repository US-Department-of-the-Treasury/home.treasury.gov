The Administration recognizes and respects the independence of the Federal Reserve in making decisions about the nation's monetary policy. We share the goal of maintaining solid economic growth with low inflation.

We have strong and balanced economic growth, supported by growing budget surpluses and substantial reductions in federal debt. We believe that the economy will continue on a sound path, led by strong private-sector investment which is creating a foundation for long-term growth and higher living standards for all Americans in the future.

With today's report showing economic growth at a strong 4.8 percent, the American economy is clearly on the right path. Looking at the two past quarters combined shows that even with the effects of Katrina, the U.S. economy is amazingly resilient. Going forward, we expect continued solid growth returning to trend.



House and Senate tax relief legislation negotiators should view today's good news as a sign to act immediately and extend the tax relief in order to sustain U.S. Economic strength. Markets are watching and it is important to send the right signal.

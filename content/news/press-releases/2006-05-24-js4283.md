The Treasury Department family joins me in mourning the death of Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. In a long and distinguished career in Washington, he served America as an accomplished representative of the people of Texas in both the House and Senate and as a wise steward of taxpayer dollars while Secretary of the Treasury. With Secretary Bentsen's passing the nation has lost a wise and thoughtful leader. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family.

Katrina is a disaster on many levels, but I'm confident that the residents of places likeNew OrleansandGulfport,Mississippi, and southernAlabamawill recover.It's the spirit of Americans to do so.Americans are resilient.We picked ourselves up after 9/11, we picked ourselves up after other disasters, and we have the will and the resources and the resolve to do so again.

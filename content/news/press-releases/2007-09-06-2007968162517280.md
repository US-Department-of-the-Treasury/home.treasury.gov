International Affairs Assistant Secretary Clay Lowery will join officials from the Inter-American Development Bank in Miami today to officially launch the 2008 annual meeting set to take place in Miami next year. The United States is honored to host the Inter-American Development Bank Annual Meeting. We thank Greater Miami for its commitment to this meeting.

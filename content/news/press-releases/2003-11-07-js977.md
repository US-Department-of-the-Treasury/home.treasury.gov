Todays employment numbers are encouraging and demonstrate growth in the economy.

They suggest that labor market conditions are becoming more favorable. The revisions to August and September showing positive job growth for those months, coupled with the pick up of 126,000 new jobs in October, is good news for American workers and families.

However we must remain vigilant in our efforts to strengthen the environment for job creation.

We must do more, as job creation has yet to take hold to the extent that it must for every person who wants a job to find one.

Thus as the President has said, we can't rest until every American who wants work can find work. So while todays report is cause for some optimism, we cannot be complacent.

This is precisely why Presidents six point plan for job creation is so important.

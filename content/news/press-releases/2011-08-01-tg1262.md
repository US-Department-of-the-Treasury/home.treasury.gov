**WASHINGTON** –The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of net marketable borrowing for the July – September 2011 and the October – December 2011 quarters:

- During the July – September 2011 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $331 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $110 billion.  This borrowing estimate is $74 billion lower than announced in May 2011.  The decrease in borrowing largely relates to lower outlays and cash balance adjustments.
- During the October – December 2011 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $285 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $100 billion.

During the April - June 2011 quarter, Treasury issued $190 billion in net marketable debt, and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $137 billion, of which $5 billion was attributable to the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP).  In May 2011, Treasury estimated $142 billion in net marketable borrowing and assumed an end-of-June cash balance of $95 billion, which included an SFP balance of $5 billion.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, August 3, 2011.

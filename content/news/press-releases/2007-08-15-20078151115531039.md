Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  this week designated 23 Colombian individuals and 23 Colombian companies tied to a leader of Colombia's North Valle drug cartel. At the peak of his career, Juan Carlos Ramirez Abadia was one of the wealthiest and most elusive drug traffickers in Colombia, said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. Today he is under arrest and his assets are under attack. OFAC will continue its assault on Chupeta's ill-gotten gains until his empire collapses.

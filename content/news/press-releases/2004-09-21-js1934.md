Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will be in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on Wednesday, September 22 and in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Thursday, September 23 to meet with local business leaders to discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs.As a result of the President's economic leadership, we have overcome a recession and seen 12 straight months of job creation, totaling 1.7 million new U.S. jobs since August 2003, said Secretary Snow.Pennsylvania has gained 57,600 new jobs so far this year, and the President's tax reform policies have ensured that more than 4.6 million Pennsylvania taxpayers will have lower income tax bills in 2004.During this trip to Pennsylvania, Secretary Snow also will discuss the Administration's efforts to control health care costs, reduce frivolous lawsuits and ensure that America has reliable and affordable sources of energy.  While the economy is on solid footing, we are not satisfied and there is still more work to be done.  We need to continue to push for pro-growth policies that will create jobs and raise standards of living, Secretary Snow said.Recent indicators show that President Bush's economic policies continue to move the economy forward.According to the Labor Department, the national unemployment rate declined to 5.4% in August – down 0.9 percentage point from a peak of 6.3% in June 2003 and the lowest rate since October 2001.At 5.4%, the unemployment rate is below the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.Employment over the last year was up in 47 of the 50 states and the unemployment rate was down in all regions and in 45 of the 50 states.The following events are open to the media, which must present media credentials or photo ID: **Wednesday, Sept. 22**Tour of Groff Tractor & Equipment, Inc.and Roundtable with Local Business Leaders**9:30 am EDT (UPDATED TIME**)Groff Tractor & Equipment, Inc.6779 Carlisle PikeMechanicsburg, PA  Media should arrive by 9:15 am**There will be a brief press availability immediately following the event**Roundtable with Regional Small Business Owners**2:00 pm EDT**Edwin L.

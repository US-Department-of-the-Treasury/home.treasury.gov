Treasury Secretary John Snow departs today for the G8 meeting in Deauville, France to discuss global economic growth.  On the eve of his departure, Snow said, Growth must remain our top priority.  I underscored this at my first G7 meeting in February, and when we last met in April, noting that the world economy is falling far short of its potential.  This remains the case today.  The United States is doing its part by aggressive and timely monetary and fiscal action.  The President’s Jobs and Growth program will further accelerate the U.S. recovery.  But a healthy global economy needs multiple engines of growth.  Our G-7 partners must immediately take their own steps, appropriate to their own circumstances, to spur growth, create jobs and contribute to global prosperity.

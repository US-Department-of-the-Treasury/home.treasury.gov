Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. attended the 2008 Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) meeting in Miami today. The United States hosted this year's annual meeting, which is an important opportunity for high-level government and private sector representatives from Latin America and the Caribbean to discuss the work of the IDB and other financial issues facing the region. The U.S. looks forward to continuing to work with the Bank to increase growth and reduce poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean, said Paulson.

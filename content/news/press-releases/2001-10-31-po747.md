WASHINGTON, DC - The Air Transportation Stabilization Board (ATSB), created by Congress to issue federal credit instruments (loan guarantees) to air carriers today launched a web site to make information available to air carriers, their lenders and the public. The purpose of these loan guarantees is to assist air carriers that suffered losses as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and to whom credit is not otherwise reasonably available, in order to facilitate a safe, efficient, and viable commercial aviation system in the United States.

The site, found at[www.treas.gov/atsb](http://www.treas.gov/atsb), offers information about the ATSB, including its members, the Office of Management and Budget regulations under which it must operate, and the ATSB guarantee application form. The web site also gives position descriptions for three executive staff members who will have the responsibility for managing the operations of the ATSB and information about how interested individuals can apply for these positions.

The web site will continue to be updated in the upcoming weeks.

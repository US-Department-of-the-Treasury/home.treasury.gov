In a speech to the Mortgage Bankers Association this morning, Treasury Secretary John Snow emphasized the importance of keeping taxes rates on investment low. The American economy proves to be on solid footing, Snow said. The question that those of us in government must look at now is this: what can we do to continue these positive trends? The answers as I see them: First, keep taxes lower on both investment and incomes. The conference committee on tax relief reconciliation is considering this matter now and I have been strongly urging them to keep tax rates low, and to act on extending the President's tax relief as soon as possible. We must protect and nurture our economic growth – not put it in jeopardy with tax increases.

The IRS will open over 300 offices nation wide this Saturday to help seniors, veterans and low-income workers file tax returns in order to receive their economic stimulus payments. As part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, certain social security and veterans beneficiaries, and lower-income workers are eligible to receive stimulus payments if they have at least $3,000 of qualifying income. Many of these Americans do not normally file tax returns because they do not have tax liability, but to receive a stimulus payment this year they must file a simple 2007 tax return. Saturday's nation-wide event is part of Treasury's ongoing efforts to reach out to those who don't normally file tax returns, but must this year to receive a stimulus payment.

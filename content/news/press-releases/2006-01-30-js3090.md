**Before the National Association of School Boards of Education (NASBE) Commission on Financial Literacy and Investor Education Alexandria, Virginia** Deputy Assistant Secretary Iannicola helped theNational Association of School Boards of Education (NASBE) launch itsCommission on Financial Literacy and Investor Education today.The Commission will produce a report which will help state school boards consider policy options for raising financial literacy among students.If financial literacy is to take firm root in America's schools it will be due in large part to policy makers at the state and local level.That's why I commend the National Association of State Boards of Education for exploring the issue of financial literacy.The state school board members I spoke with today came from all over the country, but each recognizes his or her state's children share a common need for financial education.The board members were very engaged and asked the right questions about how to support local schools, administrators and teachers as they try to prepare all of our kids for their financial futures.The Department of the Treasury is happy to lend a hand with this important project, DAS Iannicola said.

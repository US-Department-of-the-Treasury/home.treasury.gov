Secretary John Snow is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania today to meet with local business leaders. In remarks to the Philadelphia Rotary Club, the Secretary said, Today, we are growing. GDP growth has been very strong, and lots of good jobs are being created. We've seen 12 straight months of job growth, totaling 1.7 million jobs. Homeownership is at an all-time high. But there are people in Pennsylvania and elsewhere in this country who still seek work, so we are not satisfied. We must be vigilant about identifying and minimizing the barriers to economic growth and job creation.

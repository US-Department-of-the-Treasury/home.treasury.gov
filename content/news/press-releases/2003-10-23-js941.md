FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-941

Good evening.  Ambassador Argyros thank you for hosting tonights reception. Thanks for organizing so much support for the people of Iraq.  Thank you also to Jaime Malet, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Spain, for hosting this event.



This is a historic time in world affairs, and a historic opportunity for aregion called the cradle of civilization.  The land of Iraq has been freedof tyranny, and is now free to embrace democracy and rejoin the community of nations.  Where commerce once flourished, it can thrive again.  PresidentBush has committed the United States not only to ridding Iraq of an evilregime a promise we and our partners have fulfilled; he also promised tohelp Iraq to recover from a quarter-century of misrule and repression.In truth, the 22-day coalition military operation that crushed Saddamsregime was the beginning of the reconstruction process; the devastated Iraqi economy was the product of the old regimes malignant policies.



The next step in reconstruction, now in progress, is to assist the Iraqiauthorities in their efforts to create institutions and infrastructure tocreate jobs and growth through private investment, entrepreneurship, andtrade.  This will enable them to achieve economic, as well as politicalindependence. Thats why Im so pleased with the special attention on theprivate sector here in Madrid. You are just as essential to Iraqs successas the official commitments that will be announced at tomorrows conference.   Alone, these commitments cannot launch sustainable economic growth in Iraq.  For reconstruction efforts to truly succeed, these resources must help catalyze and spark domestic and international investment.Before going further, I want to say a few words about the security situationin Iraq.  I know some of you are concerned with physical risks in Iraq, andreasonably so.  I am not attempting to minimize the risk.   The risk ispresent, but a business opportunity is also present.



I firmly believe that the threat of those opposed to a free Iraq isdiminishing.  The resistance isnt growing, its dying.  Even as we speakmore international troops are arriving to supplement a strong coalitionforce already present.



To end the security threat for good, we need to continue to support astable, growing society, where every individual has rights and opportunitiesto succeed, and where life, liberty and property are treated with respect.



That means greater international support for the Iraqi people in officialaid, and it also means identifying and making private investments in Iraqsfuture -- sooner, not later.  As the Iraqi people take political andeconomic ownership of their destiny, and reenter the internationalcommunity, they will not abide lingering agitators who threaten theirprosperity and freedom.



Given that things are improving in Iraq by the minute, now is the time forforward thinking investors to seize on this unique opportunity.



If we can help the Iraqi people succeed through these early stages ofeconomic and political transition there is no reason why Iraq cannot resumeits place as a vibrant, prosperous economy, and   serve as an inspirationfor the Middle Eastern region.



Before Saddam Hussein, Iraq was a leader in the region.  Before he plunged the nation into darkness and isolation, Iraq had one of the highest nationalincomes in the region.  Iraq also had one of the best-educated populationsin the region, with a long history in fact, an ancient history ofcombining sound public sector management with a spirited entrepreneurialculture.



Consider for a moment a historical perspectives reflected in the designs ofthe new Iraqi dinar.  The Coalition Provisional Authority and the IraqiGoverning Council introduced the new dinar last week.  A major exchangeprogram is underway to replace the hodgepodge of Saddams dinars with these new bills, and create a basis for sound monetary policy.  The exchange program is an incredible undertaking, and Ive been very pleased and impressed with its organization and implementation



The new bill designs allude to Iraqs ancient roots in law, commerce, andscientific inquiry.  For example, the largest note the 25,000 dinar billhas an image of King Hammurabi, who lived almost 4,000 years ago.  Hammurabi ruled Babylon and is known for his code of laws, the first known code of laws in human history.



The 10,000 dinar note shows the philosopher Abu Ali Hasan, who was born in the city of Basra over 1,000 years ago.  Ali Hasan was both a philosopher and scientist, and in his vast research he explained, among other things, the manner in which the human eye interacts with visible light.



I think these are fascinating facts, of course, but they signify somethinglarger.  Iraq is reclaiming a great heritage of enlightenment.  This is acountry with immense potential on many fronts, with great human and natural resources.  It was once, and will again be, a great contributor to theinternational community in terms of both culture and trade.



Nonetheless, theres a long way from here to there.  Iraqi GDP in terms ofpurchasing power today is less than a third of what it was in the late1970s.  Education and health care have deteriorated substantially.  That iswhy were holding this donor conference.If Iraq is to get on its feet, it needs other international donors to be forthcoming.  Secretary Powell and I will be making that case tomorrow morning.  The World Bank has estimated reconstruction requirements of about $36 billion, with CPA estimates of an additional $19 billion for other reconstruction needs.  But as I said at the outset, Iraq cannot succeed on donor assistance alone.  Ultimately, Iraqs success will depend on many of you in this audience, as well as many like you private companies with capital investments, know-how, and technology.  And the rewards for investing now will be great.



Consider the opportunity there.  Domestic demand is primed and exportopportunities abound.  The energy sector will be large, but need only be afraction of a highly diversified economy.  Agriculture is underdeveloped,and employs 20% of the workforce.  This is, of course, the heart of thefertile crescent.



Small trading, service and manufacturing businesses are already returning inforce, and with a national transportation and communications infrastructuresolidifying, many are poised for growth.  Financial services also show greatpotential: two state-owned banks have dominated the industry but smallerdomestic and foreign financial services companies are entering the market.Remittances are pouring in from Iraqis abroad, and Iraqis at home will needall manner of banking services to support an expanding economy.



I am also confident that the new Iraqi legal framework is certain towelcome, respect and protect capital.  Iraqis understand that privateinvestment will be the key to raising national income.  Last month, theIraqi finance minister announced economic and financial reforms that permitforeigners to own up to 100% of investments in Iraq, with the exception ofoil, gas, mineral and real estate rights, which can be leased.  Sixinternational banks have been authorized to operate in Iraq.  New domesticregulations on domestic banks have increased capital requirements.  TheTrade Bank of Iraq is being established to finance food and capital goodsimports



And tax rates have been set to encourage growth, with a top marginal rate of 15% for individuals and corporations, and a 5% reconstruction tax imposed at the borders.



Finally, the macroeconomic environment has remained remarkably stableinflation has been only 2 percent, and the Governing Council has approved a sound budget for 2004 that does not allow for inflationary financing.



Iraq is a nation on the road to progress, and it will not be turned back.This nation that was a leader among its peers will be leader once again.And those who invest in that effort will benefit from an historic economicopportunity as well as playing their part in restoring a proud people totheir place among nations.



Thank you.

**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the following statement from Secretary Tim Geithner on the passage of HR 2847 in the United States Senate:

Today, the need to get Americans back to work prevailed. We saw the Senate act in a bipartisan manner to pass several of the President's top priorities, among them: tax incentives for businesses to hire new workers, a tax cut to support investments by small businesses, and additional funds to keep people at work making much-needed repairs to our roads and bridges. We hope this important step will allow the President to sign a jobs bill into law quickly. This is one of a series of critical measures to get more Americans back to work and strengthen economic growth.

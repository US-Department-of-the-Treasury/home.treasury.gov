Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. delivered remarks on the financial system Thursday afternoon at the Annual Reagan Lecture at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. Until the financial crisis is behind us, we must remain vigilant, ready to respond and to manage unpredictable events as they occur. Our first priority is on recovery. And then we will need to repair our financial system and the global system to help prevent this from ever happening again, Paulson said.

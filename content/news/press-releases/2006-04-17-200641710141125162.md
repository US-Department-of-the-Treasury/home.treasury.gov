In a statement released this morning, Treasury Secretary John Snow noted that, although Americans have a healthy, traditional dislike of the day in April when taxes are due… there is some good news on Tax Day this year because millions more Americans are working – and they're paying less in taxes thanks to tax relief signed into law by President Bush. Secretary Snow went on to point out that The benefits of lower taxes are not just felt on Tax Day. They are felt every day, in the outstanding growth of the American economy.

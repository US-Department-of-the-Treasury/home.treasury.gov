As Prepared for Delivery
I’d like to thank Commissioner Gentiloni for meeting with me today to discuss our mutual global priorities, as well as recent U.S. and European Commission initiatives.
The European Commission has been an essential partner to the United States in forming an international coalition to provide Ukraine with crucial economic support.
As you know, we have also coordinated closely to impose costs on Russia and degrade its ability to prolong Putin’s unjust war against Ukraine.
Our partnership is durable and rooted in deep and broad economic and diplomatic ties.  The EU as a whole is our biggest trading partner and critical to our efforts to “friendshore” supply chains.
In our meeting today, I look forward to discussing our shared responsibility to address Ukraine’s financing needs, the global minimum tax, and our respective China strategies.

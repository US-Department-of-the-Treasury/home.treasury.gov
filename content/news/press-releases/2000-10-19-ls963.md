Treasury monitors the Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) on an ongoing basis and has discussed its concerns about a variety of issues with a number of interested parties, including the housing GSEs themselves. The measures announced today by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, if fully implemented, are useful ones that have the potential to promote market discipline and increase transparency. Of course, there remains a range of issues with respect to GSEs that warrant continuing attention from financial authorities, the Congress and their regulators.

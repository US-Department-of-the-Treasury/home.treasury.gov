I am greatly disturbed by this act of violence on Friday night against the IRS office in Colorado Springs. Investigating this criminal act will be a top priority for IRS Commissioner Rossotti and me.

I want to reassure IRS employees that Commissioner Rossotti and I are committed to providing a safe working environment for them. I was pleased to learn that IRS employees showed up for work on Saturday morning to direct taxpayers to alternate volunteer sites. By doing so, these employees showed they represent the finest and highest traditions of public service.

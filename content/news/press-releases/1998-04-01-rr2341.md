I welcome the Senate Finance Committee's unanimous vote in support of theIRS reform bill last night. Reform legislation is an important part of the Clinton administration'sintense efforts to change and reform the IRS. The American taxpayer will be better served by theadditional rights, expanded electronic filing, better customer service and oversight measures laidout in this legislation. The Committee's bill also improves IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti'sflexibility in selecting and managing personnel.

The Committee's vote was a constructive step forward. We look forward to working withCongress to resolve a number of issues of concern as the process moves forward.

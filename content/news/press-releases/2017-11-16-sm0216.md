The third meeting of the Argentina-United States Dialogue on Illicit Finance (AUDIF) was held on November 6-7, 2017 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The main objective of this initiative is to identify and share information on money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit finance threats that may undermine the economic and financial stability of both countries. The AUDIF is further charged with developing joint strategies and initiatives to combat these financial crimes.

The most recent Dialogue covered initiatives related to sanctions development, implementation, and compliance; identification and action against the proceeds of corruption; and the forging of a common approach towards regional illicit finance threats and vulnerabilities.

For the United States, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury co-chaired the Dialogue along with the Financial Information Unit (FIU) of the Republic of Argentina. They were joined by representatives from the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the United States Department of Justice, and the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), as well as representatives from the Argentine FIU, Cabinet of Ministers, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, Central Bank of Argentina, National Securities Commission, Federal Administration of Public Revenue, Superintendency of Insurance, Ministry of the Treasury, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Worship.

Treasury Secretary John Snow highlighted the need for nations to spur global economic growth during this weekend meetings he hosted with the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors. While the U.S. economy is achieving growth in a strengthening recovery, the global economy needs all regions to generate higher growth rates. We all depend on each other, said Snow. Stronger global growth is in the U.S. interest, and of the G-7, and the world. We also recognize that more work is needed to ensure growth that is broad-based and sustainable, and is less reliant on a single engine.

​*As Prepared for Delivery*

Thank you for the kind introduction and for inviting me to participate in today’s conference.  Before I begin and in observance of Veteran’s Day, I would like to recognize the veterans in our audience and thank you for your service to our country.    There is another group of veterans who have participated in every major United States military engagement since World War I, our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico.  This long history of service includes the exceptional heroism and gallantry of Puerto Rico’s 65th Infantry Regiment, known as the Borinqueneers, who served in the Korean War.  Since 9/11, more than 25,000 active duty Puerto Rican soldiers have served across all branches of the armed forces, carrying out more than 38,000 deployments.  A recent survey showed that more than half of the Island’s residents have either served in the military or have a family member who has served.  Nine Puerto Ricans have been awarded Medals of Honor. ‎This history of service is remarkable.

Secretary John Snow and U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral will unveil the first $1 notes with the new Treasurer's signature on Tuesday, April 26 at the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, DC. Having my signature on the U.S. currency is a tremendous honor; sharing that honor with Anna Cabral is priceless, said Secretary Snow.

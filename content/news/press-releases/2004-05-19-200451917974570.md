Juan Zarate, Treasury’s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, testified today before the Senate Finance Committee on his nomination to be Assistant Secretary for Treasury’s new Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).  TFI will lead Treasury’s efforts to cut the lines of financial support to international terrorists, a critical component of the Administration’s overall effort to keep America safe from terrorist plots.  In addition, TFI is charged with protecting the integrity of the financial system, fighting financial crime, enforcing economic sanctions against rogue nations and assisting in the ongoing hunt for Iraqi assets.

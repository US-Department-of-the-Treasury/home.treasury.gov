JS-3060

I was pleased by the passage today of the Deficit Reduction Act in the Senate.  Deficit reduction is an essential part of President Bush's long-term economic strategy.  The Senate's action today demonstrates the courage required to make difficult choices that help keep us on the path of reaching the President's goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009.

On Monday evening, in Brazil, Treasury Secretary John Snow delivered the following statement, We want the president's full package and $550 billion is the minimum number.  We want to make sure that all of the components of the president's plan are in the final package.  Our preferred option is to go to the president's full package immediately. We'll continue to press for the biggest number we can get.  We're not giving up on persuading additional people in the Senate that a bigger number makes sense.

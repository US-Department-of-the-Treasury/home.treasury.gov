Furthering the commitments made by U.S. President George W. Bush and the Mexican President Vicente Fox during their historic summit in September 2001, the United States and Mexico will jointly sponsor the 'Partnership for Prosperity' Entrepreneurial Workshop in San Francisco June 9-10 to encourage U.S. and Mexican private sector involvement in Mexico's economic future.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Mexico's Secretary of the Economy Fernando Canales will host the conference and U.S. Treasurer Rosario Marin will be the mistress of ceremonies and the moderator for the entire conference, which will promote contact between the U.S. and Mexican business communities.

Investors and business owners from both countries will meet with university leaders, leading non-governmental organizations and government experts to discuss investment and financing opportunities in Mexico.  There will also be an opportunity for networking among the Mexican and U.S. private sector participants.  Business sectors represented will include information and environmental technology, housing finance and construction, agribusiness and food processing, infrastructure, and the automotive industry.

Other panels will explore enterprise financing; regulations, taxes and procedures required for doing business in North America; and the enhancement of human capital on economic development in Mexico. Senior U.S. and Mexican corporate and government leaders also will discuss the competitiveness of the North American market and corporate citizenship.

U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will travel to Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida on Thursday, February 24 and Friday, February 25 to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve the U.S. Social Security system.

President Bush has discussed the importance of Social Security and the need to fix the Social Security system for future generations of Americans, said Secretary Snow.The President has assured Americans that he will not change the Social Security system in any way for those born before 1950.

Social Security is sound for today's seniors and for those nearing retirement, but it needs to be fixed for younger workers – our children and grandchildren. To keep the promise of Social Security alive for our children and grandchildren, we need to fix Social Security now once and for all.

​**Washington** – A U.S. Department of the Treasury Spokesperson today issued the following statement in response to an editorial in the Wall Street Journal on the implementation of the “employer mandate” under the*Affordable Care Act*:   “The ACA’s “employer mandate” unfortunately remains the law of the land, and IRS has informed Treasury that it is sending notices to employers assessing their tax obligation under the law. Treasury lawyers see no ground for the Secretary to direct the IRS to not collect the tax. In fact, when the Obama administration delayed collecting this tax, the Wall Street Journal called the delay a “[lawless rewrite](https://www.wsj.com/articles/obama-rewrites-obamacare-1392075371)” and of “[dubious legality](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323899704578583493972896364?mg=com-wsj).”  This tax is yet another example of how Obamacare is hurting the American people and needs to be repealed.”   ####

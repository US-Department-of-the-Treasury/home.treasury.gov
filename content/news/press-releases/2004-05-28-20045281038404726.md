On the one-year anniversary of the President's Jobs and Growth Relief Act of 2003, Secretary John Snow highlighted how its passage has lead to a full turnaround in the economy. Economic indicators across the board are very strong, the unemployment rate has gone down in 46 of 50 states, and household wealth is at an all-time high, he said. Congress should work with the Presidents to ensure further economic growth by making the Jobs and Growth tax cuts permanent.Click here for Snow's statement

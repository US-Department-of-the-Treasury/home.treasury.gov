**Washington**–*U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today after President Trump's speech on tax reform in Mandan, North Dakota:*

President Trump made a forceful case for comprehensive tax reform to level the playing field for American job creators and spur economic growth that will yield millions of new jobs. Middle-income families in North Dakota and across the country deserve a tax cut, and the President is committed to simplifying the tax code to put more money in their pockets. During today's visit, the President put a personal face on the harmful impact the death tax has on farmers and ranchers in North Dakota. I look forward to working with Congress to provide relief from this and other onerous taxes, jumpstart our economy, increase wages, and create more opportunity for Americans.

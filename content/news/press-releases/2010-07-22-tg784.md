**WASHINGTON**–The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)today designated two Mexican entities,*Arte y Diseno de Culiacan S.A. de C.V. *and*Autotransportes JYM S.A. de C.V.*, for being owned and operated by Maria Teresa and Midiam Patricia Zambada Niebla, front persons and daughters of notorious Mexican drug lord Ismael Zambada Garcia.Today's action, pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act), prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with the two designated entities and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Ismael Zambada Garcia and the Sinaloa Cartel were identified by the President as significant foreign narcotics traffickers pursuant to the Kingpin Act in 2002 and 2009, respectively.  In May 2007, OFAC designated Maria Teresa and Midiam Patricia Zambada Niebla, among other operatives, as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers for their roles in the financial network of the Zambada Garcia drug trafficking organization.  Zambada Garcia is a fugitive from U.S. and Mexican authorities.He is the subject of indictments filed in the U.S. District Courts for the District of Columbia, the Eastern District of New York, and the Northern District of Illinois on drug trafficking charges.The U.S. Department of State is offering up to $5 million for informationleading to his capture.In March 2009, Mexico's Office of the Attorney Generalannounced rewards of up to $2.1 million for information leading toZambada Garcia's arrest.

"Zambada Garcia maintains an insidious presence in the Mexican drug trade as one of the most powerful and longstanding leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel.In April 2010, Zambada Garcia told a Mexican newsmagazine that if he can do business in the United States, he will.We're telling Mr. Zambada that he will not," said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin."The U.S. commercial and financial sectors are closed to Zambada Garcia and his drug trafficking network."

Today's action is the latest in a series of efforts by OFAC to thwart the illicit activities of Mexican drug cartels.TheSinaloa Cartel, one of Mexico's most dangerous drug gangs, is responsible for smuggling considerable quantities of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine to the United States.Members of the Sinaloa Cartel have perpetrated many of the heinous acts of violence in ongoing drug turf wars.

Internationally, OFAC has designated nearly 800 businesses and individuals linked to 87 drug kingpins since June 2000.Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties.  Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million.Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million.Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. will deliver remarks in Chicago tonight to the Economic Club of Chicago. His remarks will focus on the U.S. economy and capital markets. While I expect the economy to continue to grow this year, the housing correction continues to pose the biggest downside risk. And we at Treasury are focused on the housing and mortgage markets, said Paulson.

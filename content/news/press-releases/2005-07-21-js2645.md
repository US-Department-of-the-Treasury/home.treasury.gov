JS-2645

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated six sons of Saddam Hussein's half brother and former presidential advisor, Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti.  This designation is part of an ongoing effort by the Treasury, U.S. Central Command and our partners in the U.S. Government to halt the flow of money and resources to anti-Coalition forces.

"This action targets the money flows of former regime elements actively supporting attacks against Coalition forces and the Iraqi people," said Stuart Levey, the Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI).

The following individuals were designated today under Executive Order 13315, which is aimed at blocking the property of the former Iraqi regime, its senior officials and their family members:  Yasir Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti (Yasir), Omar Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti (Omar), Ayman Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti (Ayman), Ibrahim Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti (Ibrahim), Bashar Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti (Bashar) and Sa'd Sabawi Ibrahim Hasan Al-Tikriti (Sa'd).  In addition, the U.S. Government is submitting the individuals to the United Nations for listing by the 1518 Committee under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483.

Information available to the U.S. Government indicates that after Operation Iraqi Freedom, Yasir, Omar, Ayman and Bashar provided support to elements of the former regime and to groups carrying out attacks against Iraqi and Coalition forces, as well as against Iraqi civilians.

Yasir, Omar, and Bashar directed a number of anti-Coalition activities in Iraq and maintained communication with several insurgent groups throughout northern and central Iraq.

Yasir, who allegedly acted as a financier and bodyguard for Saddam Hussein prior to Saddam's capture by U.S. forces, provided financial support, weapons and explosives to anti-Coalition elements.  Notably, after Operation Iraqi Freedom, Yasir transferred funds to regime loyalists, including a large sum of money to Saddam's wife, Sajida Khayrallah Tilfah, on Saddam's behalf.Omar supported former Iraqi Ba'ath Party members after Operation Iraqi Freedom, according to information available to the U.S. Government.  Omar provided financial support and operational direction to anti-Coalition activities, including several attacks in Mosul, Iraq.

Ayman helped finance anti-Coalition attacks in central Iraq carried by the Fedayeen Saddam, an Iraqi paramilitary organization formerly headed by Saddam Hussein's son Uday.  Ayman also urged Ba'athist loyalists to attack Iraq's infrastructure, notably oil pipelines, water and power facilities.

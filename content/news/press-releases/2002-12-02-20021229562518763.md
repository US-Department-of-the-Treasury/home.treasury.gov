At last week's bill signing, Secretary O’Neill said, “This legislation is a critical element in our economic recovery. It reduces the economic risks and economic consequences associated with the threat of future terrorist attacks. It will help restore insurance capacity to the marketplace, which will promote new construction and spur economic activity.”  President Bush made passage of this legisaltion a top priority during the lameduck session of Congress.

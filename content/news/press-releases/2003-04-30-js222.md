The current statutory debt limit situation will not affect this quarterly refunding.The Treasury will ensure that there is sufficient borrowing capacity on May 15th to settle the notes auctioned next week.However, on current projections, the extraordinary measures taken sinceFebruary 20, 2003will only be adequate to meet the governments needs until the latter half of May.

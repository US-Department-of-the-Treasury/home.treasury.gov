Treasury is supporting efforts to minimize hurricane related disturbances in a number of ways including expediting check delivery in the affected areas for certain federal benefits that were scheduled for regular delivery in the first week of the month. Nearly 400,000 people in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida received their federal benefit checks, including Social Security payments, in advance last week. Government-wide information on hurricane preparation and recovery efforts is available at[www.ready.gov](http://www.ready.gov/).

**Washington**– The U.S. Department of the Treasury today launched the first phase of its modernized website, Treasury.gov. Over the coming months, the Department will update and migrate the remaining content from its legacy site to its newly redesigned site, which will provide improved navigation and functionality.

“The new Treasury.gov will give the American people a user-friendly online experience as they learn about the critical work the Treasury is doing to spur economic growth and job creation, combat illicit finance, and safeguard the integrity of the financial system,” said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.

The new site features added content and enhanced visual effects, and it will be optimized for use on a wide variety of devices including desktop computers as well as tablets and hand-held devices.

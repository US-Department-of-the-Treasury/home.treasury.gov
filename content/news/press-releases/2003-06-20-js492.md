FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-492

We are pleased that the DC Court of Appeals has upheld Treasury's ability to employ a vital tool in the war on terrorist financing. The power to freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them is one of our most effective weapons in preventing future acts of terror.

- Treasury General Counsel David Aufhauser

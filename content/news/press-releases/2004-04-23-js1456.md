The governments of the United StatesandColombia, along with The Nature Conservancy, Conservation International Foundation, and World Wildlife Fund, Inc. recentlysigned agreementsthat will reduceColombia’s debt to theU.S.by over ten million dollars.In return, the Government of Colombia has committed to using this savings to fund local conservation projects for the protection and conservation of several important tropical forest areas inColombia.

More specifically, the savings will be focused on two priorities: funding conservation activities in these important tropical forest regions, and creating a permanent endowment to provide sustainable funding to these areas in the future.

The areas benefiting from the agreement include the forests of the northeastern tropicalAndes, the Llanos region in theOrinocoBasin, and theCaribbean.The tropicalAndescontain one of the largest tracts ofoak forestin the country.The Llanos region is home to many species, including the giant armadillo, jaguar, river dolphin and theOrinococrocodile.TheCaribbeanregion also contains several unique species.

These agreements will be implemented by a committee that will include representatives from the governments ofColombiaand the United States, as well as representatives from The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund, and Conservation International. To carry out this debt-for-nature swap, the U.S. Government used $7 million of funds appropriated under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA), and the Nature Conservancy, Conservation International and World Wildlife Fund contributed $1.4 million.

The preservation of tropical forest regions is critically important to the global environment.This innovative “debt-for-nature” arrangement is made possible under TFCA.Colombiais the seventh country to benefit from programs under the TFCA – the other countries areBangladesh,Belize,El Salvador,Peru, thePhilippines, andPanama.The TFCA was enacted in 1998 to provide eligible developing countries the opportunity to reduce their concessional debts owed to the United Stateswhile at the same time generating funds for activities to conserve important tropical forests.

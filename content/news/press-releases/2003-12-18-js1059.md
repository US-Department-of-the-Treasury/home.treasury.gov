I congratulate the United States Mint and Director Henrietta Holsman Fore for receiving the highest score of all Federal agencies in the University of Michigan Business School’s 2003 American Customer Satisfaction Index.  For eight years in a row, the U.S. Mint has been a leader among government agencies and the private sector in customer satisfaction by consistently offering its customers exciting new products and exemplary customers care.  The dedicated public servants of the U.S. Mint have made their agency an example for all others to follow and I commend them for their hard work.

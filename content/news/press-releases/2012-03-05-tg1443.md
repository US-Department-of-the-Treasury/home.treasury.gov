**Targets Main Syrian Broadcasters Supporting Violent Crackdown**



**WASHINGTON –**The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today identified the Syrian General Organization of Radio and TV as subject to sanctions imposed on the Government of Syria in Executive Order (E.O.) 13582 of August 17, 2011.



E.O. 13582 blocks all property and interests in property of the Government of Syria, which includes its agencies, instrumentalities and controlled entities, within U.S. jurisdiction, whether specifically identified by OFAC or not.U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in business with any Syrian state-owned entity. Today’s identification is intended to aid compliance with E.O. 13582.



The General Organization of Radio and TV is a state-run agency subordinate to Syria’s Ministry of Information.It is responsible for operating Syria’s state-owned television channels, two terrestrial and one satellite, as well as the government radio stations.



The Syrian regime’s use of state entities to repress and attack civilians has imposed a devastating toll on the people of Syria.The United States has consistently stood against this abuse and has taken strong steps to target the regime’s ability to act against the Syrian people.



“The General Organization of Radio and TV has served as an arm of the Syrian regime as it mounts increasingly barbaric attacks on its own population and seeks both to mask and legitimize its violence.By taking this action today, Treasury is sending a clear signal that it stands with the Syrian people.Any individuals or institutions supporting its abhorrent behavior will be targeted and cut off from the international financial system,” said Adam Szubin, Director of Treasury’s OFAC.



U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with the Government of Syria, including the General Organization of Radio and TV, and any assets the Government of Syria may have subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

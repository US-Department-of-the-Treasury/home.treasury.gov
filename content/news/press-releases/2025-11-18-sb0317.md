**WASHINGTON –**The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for August (delayed by the partial shutdown of the federal government) and September 2025.  The next release, which will report on data for October 2025, is scheduled for December 18, 2025.

The sum total of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $187.1 billion in August and $190.1 billion in September.  Of this, in August, net foreign private inflows were $224.9 billion, and net foreign official outflows were $37.9 billion.  In September, net foreign private inflows were $213.9 billion, and net foreign official outflows were $23.7 billion.

Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in August and September; their net purchases were $181.2 billion in August and $208.5 billion in September.  In August, net purchases by private foreign investors were $196.4 billion, while net sales by foreign official institutions were $15.1 billion.  In September, net purchases by private foreign investors were $210.7 billion, while net sales by foreign official institutions were $2.2 billion.

U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $47.0 billion in August and $28.7 billion in September.

After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $134.2 billion in August and $179.8 billion in September.

Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $25.0 billion in August but decreased their holdings by $22.0 billion in September.  Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $12.1 billion in August but decreased by $8.3 billion in September.

Banks’ own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased by $40.8 billion in August and $18.6 billion in September.

Complete data are available on the Treasury website[here](https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system).  Original data for August are archived there.  The August figures in this press release are from the most recent data, which in some cases have been revised from the original data.

About TIC Data

The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.  These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.  For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.  The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.  In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.  For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.

| /1 | | | Net U.S. sales = Net foreign purchases of U.S. securities (+). | | | | | | | | |
| /2 | | | Includes international and regional organizations. | | | | | | | | |
| /3 | | | The reported division of net U.S. sales of long-term securities between net sales to foreign official institutions and net sales | | | |
| | | | | to other foreign investors is subject to a "transaction bias" described in Frequently Asked Questions 7 and 10.a.4 on the TIC website. | |
| /4 | | | Net transactions in foreign securities by U.S. residents. Foreign purchases of foreign securities = U.S. sales of foreign securities to foreigners. | |
| | | | | Thus negative entries indicate net U.S. purchases of foreign securities, or an outflow of capital from the United States; positive entries | |
| | | | | indicate net U.S. sales of foreign securities. | | | | | | | | |

| | | | | increase in nonmarketable Treasury Bonds and Notes Issued to Official Institutions and Other Residents of Foreign Countries. | | |
| /6 | | | These are primarily data on monthly changes in banks' and broker/dealers' custody liabilities. Data on custody claims are collected | | |
| | | | | quarterly and published in the TIC website. | | | | | | | | |
| /7 | | | "Selected Other Liabilities" are primarily the foreign liabilities of U.S. customers that are managed by U.S. banks or broker/dealers. | | |
| /8 | | | TIC data cover most components of international financial flows, but do not include data on direct investment flows, which are collected | |
| | | | | and published by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In addition to the monthly data summarized here, the | |
| | | | | TIC collects quarterly data on some banking and nonbanking assets and liabilities. Frequently Asked Question 1 on the TIC website | |
| | | | | describes the scope of TIC data collection. | | | | | | | | |

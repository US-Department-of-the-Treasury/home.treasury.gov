“Sarah Bloom Raskin is a proven leader whose experience and knowledge will be a tremendous asset to the Treasury Department.  As a Federal Reserve Governor and former state banking regulator, Sarah has a deep understanding of banking and financial regulatory issues as well as a firm grasp of how to run large, complex organizations.  Throughout her career, Sarah has demonstrated a strong commitment to protecting consumers, and she shares my conviction to do everything possible to increase job creation, accelerate economic growth, and strengthen the middle class.  I am grateful Sarah has agreed to take on this critical position, once confirmed, and I know she will live up to the high standard set by Neal Wolin and build on his outstanding legacy.”

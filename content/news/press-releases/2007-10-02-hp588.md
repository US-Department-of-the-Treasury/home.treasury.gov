U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral will discuss ways to bring more Americans into the financial mainstream at the Financial Education and Literacy Commission's regional conference in New York City on Thursday.

More than 10 million Americans do not have access to mainstream financial services, such as banks or credit unions, making them more likely to pay extraordinarily high fees for basic services and less likely to save for the future.DeputyAssistant Secretary for Financial Education Dan Iannicola, Jr. will join officials from the National Credit Union Administration and theNew York City Department of Consumer Affairs as featured speakers.

The regional conference is the fourth in a series of national discussions that will be held as part of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission's National Strategy for Financial Literacy. For more information about the Commission visit its website at[www.mymoney.gov](http://www.mymoney.gov/).

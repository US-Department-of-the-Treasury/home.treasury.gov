WASHINGTON — The Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) today released its*Report on Digital Asset Financial Stability Risks and Regulation*. The Council voted to approve the report in response to Section 6 of President Biden’s Executive Order 14067, “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.”

As called for by the Executive Order, the report reviews financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by various types of digital assets and provides recommendations to address such risks.

“This report provides a strong foundation for policymakers as we work to mitigate the financial stability risks of digital assets while realizing the potential benefits of innovation,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “It is an important contribution to the set of reports that Treasury and our interagency partners have produced as part of President Biden’s executive order. The report concludes that crypto-asset activities could pose risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system and emphasizes the importance of appropriate regulation, including enforcement of existing laws. It is vital that government stakeholders collectively work to make progress on these recommendations.”

Deputy Secretary Robert M. Kimmitt delivered remarks in New York City today to the U.S. Israel Executive Summit. Reaffirming the gains made by lowering investment barriers will inspire confidence in the financial markets, while raising such barriers would do just the opposite. Navigating the current economic conditions will require focused and grounded policies, not short-sighted retrenchment, said Kimmitt.

IRS Deputy Commissioner Mike Dolan, the highest ranking career official in the agency, has announced his intention to leave the IRS after 27 years of dedicated public service. Beginning in March 1992, Mike served as Deputy Commissioner of the agency. After 5 years as Deputy Commissioner, Mike stepped in to lead the Service as Acting Commissioner last year for the second time, and he provided strong leadership at the Service during a difficult period.



As Deputy Commissioner, he has played a primary role in refocusing the IRS on providing better service to taxpayers and fundamentally reexamining IRS operations. He worked closely with the National Treasury Employees Union on several, innovative labor-management initiatives. And as someone who rose through the ranks of the Service, he earned the respect both of front-line employees all over the country, and officials at the highest levels of government. In both 1987 and 1994, he received Meritorious Presidential Rank Awards.



In working on IRS issues over the last few years, I have personally developed an enormous amount of respect for Mike Dolan's abilities, leadership, and character. For his longtime commitment to improving the functioning of government, we are grateful to Mike and hopeful that he will continue working with us in the Treasury Department.

I welcome the announcement today by the Iraqi government and U.N. on the International Compact for Iraq. We strongly support this important initiative, and look forward to working with Iraqi leadership, the United Nations and other members of the preparatory group to help Iraq realize its vision of a united, stable and prosperous nation underpinned by a self-sustaining economy. We endorse the priorities that have been identified to achieve these goals, and especially welcome the attention to good governance, the rule of law, a solid budgetary framework, the development of a transparent and efficient oil sector and strong, credible institutions.



At President Bush's request, I recently traveled to Europe, Iraq and the Gulf with State Department Counselor Philip Zelikow in order to discuss the Compact. In Baghdad, I had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister and other senior Iraqi officials. They are already undertaking the hard work necessary to bring this initiative to a successful conclusion by the end of this year. We look forward to reviewing their progress at the UN General Assembly and World Bank and IMF meetings in September.

​  **WASHINGTON** – Today, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew spoke by telephone with leaders of advocacy organizations that focus on LGBT issues to discuss the recently announced proposed regulations for same-sex couples for federal tax purposes. 
Secretary Lew recognized the tremendous strides that the United States has made in recent times in the fight for marriage equality. 
Secretary Lew discussed how these new proposed regulations confirm that a marriage of two individuals, whether of the same sex or the opposite sex, will be recognized for federal tax purposes if that marriage is recognized by any state, possession, or territory of the United States.
Secretary Lew explained how the proposed regulations would interpret the terms “husband” and “wife” to cover same-sex spouses in the same way as opposite-sex spouses and that they will ensure that all legally married couples are treated the same, under the tax code.
Secretary Lew emphasized how this announcement clarifies and strengthens the guidance that was issued in 2013 and updates those rules to reflect that same-sex couples can now marry in all states and that all states will recognize these marriages.   Secretary Lew concluded the call by stating his deep appreciation for the work of the groups and the key role they play in fighting for marriage equality. He noted that while there is still more work to be done, their dedication to the issue is helping to make our country a better place for all who live here.

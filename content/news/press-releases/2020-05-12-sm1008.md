WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury made a number of important announcements on the Payroll Support Program under Title IV of the CARES Act.



Since announcing the Payroll Support Program, Treasury has approved over $25 billion in assistance to 352 applicants, supporting hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Approved applicants include all of the major passenger air carriers, more than 260 smaller passenger air carriers, and a significant number of cargo air carriers and contractors.



Treasury is also announcing new transparency measures for the program. A list of Payroll Support Program participants, with amounts of assistance provided and, where applicable, financial instruments provided to the Federal Government as appropriate compensation for the provision of financial assistance, is available online [here](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/cares/preserving-jobs-for-american-industry/payroll-support-program-payments). Treasury continues to work closely with approved applicants to execute the necessary agreements and will update this information as additional funds are disbursed.



“The Payroll Support Program is successfully supporting American workers and preserving our vital aviation industry,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “Treasury is committed to the highest standards of public transparency as we provide this critical relief.”

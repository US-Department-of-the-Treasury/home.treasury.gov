WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen released the following statement on the staff-level agreement between Ukraine and the IMF for a new economic program.
“I welcome the announcement by the International Monetary Fund that it has reached a staff-level agreement with Ukraine on a 4-year Extended Fund Facility program for $15.6 billion. An ambitious and appropriately conditioned IMF program is critical to underpin Ukraine’s reform efforts, including to strengthen good governance and address risks of corruption, and provide much needed financial support. It will also bolster the economic assistance that the United States and our partners have provided that is funding essential services like schools, hospitals, and first responders, and which is offering vital support to the Ukrainian economy. This agreement is an important step towards a program and reflects months of collaborative work between the IMF and Ukrainian government, supported by Treasury and other partners of Ukraine. The United States will stand with the government and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes in the face of Russia’s unjust, unlawful, and immoral war."

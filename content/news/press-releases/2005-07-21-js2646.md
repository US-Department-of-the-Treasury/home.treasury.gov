JS-2646

The U. S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has adopted a policy to issue specific licenses, on a case by case basis, authorizing U.S. persons to engage in certain transactions with the following Colombian Government-controlled entities, which have been designated by OFAC as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNTs) pursuant to 31 CFR Part 536:

- Agropecuaria el Nilo S.A. (AGRONILO), NIT # 800099699-5;
- Casa Grajales S.A., NIT # 891902138-1;
- Frutas Exoticas Colombianas S.A. (FREXCO), NIT # 800183514-0;
- Grajales S.A., NIT # 891900090-8;
- Los Vinedos de Getsemani S.A. (HOTEL LOS VINEDOS), NIT # 800108902-6;
- Transportes del Espiritu Santo S.A., NIT # 821002436-5.

The Government of Colombia took control of these companies in June 2005.  By establishing a licensing policy, OFAC is ensuring that these entities continue to operate and do so in a legitimate manner under the control of the Colombian government, thereby preserving the jobs of several thousand Colombians who were unknowingly manipulated by leaders of the North Valle drug cartel. OFAC continues to work closely with Colombian officials to monitor the situation.

U.S. persons seeking a license to engage in certain transactions with these six companies should submit a written license application in accordance with 31 CFR 501.801(b) to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Licensing Division, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Annex, Washington, DC 20220.

In addition to the information required by 31 CFR 501.801(b)(3), the application must include a detailed description of the proposed transactions, the source and method of payment and a copy of a signed agreement from any of the aforementioned companies regarding the type of activity for which a license is sought.  Non-press questions regarding this policy should be directed to OFAC's Licensing Division at (202) 622-2480.

Due to the lapse in appropriations, the non-seasonally adjusted U.S. City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI) for October 2025 has not been reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

Accordingly, Treasury is announcing an index number pursuant to the index contingency provisions for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) in the Uniform Offering Circular (UOC, available in [Appendix B to 31 CFR Part 356](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-II/subchapter-A/part-356#ap31.2.356_135.b)). Based on the calculations described in the UOC, the index number for October 2025 is 325.604.

Treasury will base its calculations of its payment obligations that rely on October 2025 CPI on this index number. For the purposes of such calculations, Treasury will not replace this index number even if BLS subsequently reports actual CPI for October 2025

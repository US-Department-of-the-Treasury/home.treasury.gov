**WASHINGTON** –The findings from the annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2015 were released today and posted on the Treasury web site at[https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx](https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system-home-page/tic-forms-instructions/securities-c-annual-cross-us-border-portfolio-holdings).

The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

A complementary survey measuring foreign holdings of U.S. securities is also conducted annually.  Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held at end-June 2016, are currently being processed.  Preliminary results are expected to be reported on February 28, 2017.

Overall Results

This survey measured the value of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2015 as approximately $9.5 trillion, with $6.8 trillion held in foreign equity, $2.3 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.  The previous such survey, conducted as of year-end 2014, measured U.S. holdings of approximately $9.6 trillion, with $6.7 trillion held in foreign equity, $2.5 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities, and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.  The decline during 2015 occurred entirely in debt.

U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities by country at the end of 2015 were the largest for the United Kingdom ($1.24 trillion), followed by the Cayman Islands ($1.22 trillion), Japan ($822 billion), and Canada ($705 billion) (see Table 2).  These four countries attracted 42 percent of total U.S. portfolio investment, versus 41 percent the previous year.The surveys are part of an internationally coordinated effort under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to improve the measurement of portfolio asset holdings.

* Greater than zero but less than $500 million.[1] The stock of foreign securities for December 31, 2015, reported in this survey may not, for a number of reasons, correspond to the stock of foreign securities on December 31, 2014, plus cumulative flows reported in Treasury's transactions reporting system.  An analysis of the relationship between the stock and flow data is available in Table 4 and the associated text of the "Report on U.S. Portfolio Holdings of Foreign Securities at end-year 2015."  Items may not sum to totals due to rounding.[2] China, Hong Kong, and Macau are each reported separately.

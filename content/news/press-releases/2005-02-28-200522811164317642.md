Secretary Snow today addressed the annual conference of the Credit Union National Association in Washington, DC, and highlighted the need for Social Security reform. What the President would rather see for future generations is an ability to save some of their payroll taxes, to build a nest egg that belongs to the worker, not to the government. A nest egg that would have a real return on investment, far better than the rapidly-weakening promise of Social Security benefits.

The Labor Department announced that 157,000 jobs were created in May, with 2 million new jobs over the past 12 months. Our economy has now added jobs for 45 straight months and the unemployment rate remains low at 4.5 percent. Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Phillip Swagel discussed job growth and the state of the U.S. economy this week at his monthly economic press briefing. The economy is on track to rebound in the second quarter and beyond following a slowdown of late-2006 and early this year, said Swagel. The strong labor market will support household spending, and this in turn will drive a continued upturn in business investment.

LS-551

The newspaper reports that suggested that Smith & Wesson was not honoring its agreement - or reneging in any way - on its agreement with the federal, state and local governments are inaccurate and misleading. The agreement is in full force and effect. Clearly, there will be questions that need interpretation as we go along, as this agreement is historic and without precedent. We will address those questions as they arise.

John B. Taylor, Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, will travel to Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua to discuss economic growth and development in these Central American nations. Taylor will depart Washington on Sunday, June 30 and return on Thursday, July 4.

The trip presents an opportunity to observe the unique challenges these nations face as they try to improve standards of living, raise productivity and create economic growth. The visit is well timed as the the Administration is working to develop standards for President Bush’s Millennium Challenge Account program.

Taylor will visit private businesses, schools, export processing and free trade zones and other development projects. He will also meet with government officials and representatives of non-governmental organizations.

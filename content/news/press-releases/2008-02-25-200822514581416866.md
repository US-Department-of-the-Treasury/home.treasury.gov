The Department of the Treasury announced economic sanctions Monday against two key financial operatives of the Burmese regime. This is the latest in a string of actions taken by the Administration against the Burmese junta and their inner circle. As one element of our policy to promote a genuine democratic transition, the U.S. maintains targeted sanctions that focus on the assets of regime members and their cronies who grow rich while Burma's people suffer under their misrule, said President Bush in a statement Monday.

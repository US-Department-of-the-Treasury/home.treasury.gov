President Iglesias, my fellow Governors, ladies and gentlemen:

6. Unfortunately, there is a danger that governments will think that the reforms undertaken and the economic resiliency achieved over the past decade need only be maintained, that increased market openness is unnecessary or, even worse, at odds with social development. This is particularly relevant as elections approach in many countries in the region. If there is one lesson we should have learned from the efforts made over the past several years, it is that prudent macroeconomic policies, an open trading environment, and healthy financial markets are necessary conditions for strong and sustainable growth. We have also learned that growth, if it is to last, can be -- and must be -- accompanied by policies that ensure that benefits are shared by all segments of society.

Fiscal and Monetary Discipline

Highlighting the importance of prudent fiscal and monetary policy to an audience such as this is stating the obvious. Many countries in the region have had to undertake painful but necessary steps to compensate for a history of fiscal or monetary excess. Yet, even as fiscal deficits shrink throughout much of the region, even as inflation continues to decline to levels generally on par with many industrialized nations, the markets still require a premium for past digressions. Only by continually showing progress will this premium be reduced. To backslide now would be a tragedy.Trade and Integration

*Action Supports U.S. Commitment to Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina*
 
**WASHINGTON** – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Milorad Dodik, President of Republika Srpska (RS), one of two entities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The designation was made pursuant to Executive Order 13304, which authorizes sanctions against individuals and entities who have actively obstructed or who pose a significant risk of actively obstructing the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace (the Dayton Accords) or the Conclusions of the Peace Implementation Conference held in London on December 8–9, 1995.  Specifically, Dodik was designated for his role in defying the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina in violation of the rule of law, thereby actively obstructing the Dayton Accords; Dodik was also designated for conduct that poses a significant risk of actively obstructing the same.  The Dayton Accords provide for a democratic republic with a bicameral parliament but assign many governmental functions to RS and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 
“By obstructing the Dayton Accords, Milorad Dodik poses a significant threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina,” said John E. Smith, Acting OFAC Director.  “Today’s action underscores the U.S. commitment to the Dayton Accords and supports international efforts for the country’s continued European integration.” 
 
As a result of today’s action, any property or interest in property of Dodik within U.S. jurisdiction is blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with him.  Additionally, persons who provide material support to persons designated under this Executive Order, including Dodik, may also be subject to designation.

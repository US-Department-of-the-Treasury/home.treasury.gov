The Governments of the United States of America and the Republic of Indonesia, together with two environmental NGOs, Conservation International and Yayasan Keanekaragaman Hayati Indonesia (KEHATI), have signed agreements forthe largest debt-for-nature swap under the Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA) since its passage in 1998.The agreements will reduce Indonesia's debt payments to the United States Government by nearly $30 million over the next eight years. In return, the Government of Indonesia has committed these funds to support grants to protect and restore the country's tropical forests.



Indonesia is one of the most biologically-diverse countries on earth.Funds generated by this program will help protect several forest areas on the island of Sumatra.These forests are home to species found only in Indonesia, including the endangered Sumatran tiger, elephant, rhino and orangutan.In addition, these forests provide important ecosystem services such as maintaining the quality and quantity of freshwater supplies and carbon sequestration.



The swap is made possible through contributions of $20 million by the U.S. Government under the TFCA and a combined donation of $2 million from Conservation International and KEHATI.Grants provided under the TFCA program will support activities such as conserving protected areas, improving natural resource management and supporting the development of sustainable livelihoods for communities that rely on forests.



The Indonesia agreement marks the 15thTFCA deal, following agreements with Bangladesh, Belize, Botswana, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Panama (two agreements), Paraguay, Peru (two agreements) and the Philippines. Over time, these debt-for-nature programs together will generate more than $218 million to protect tropical forests.

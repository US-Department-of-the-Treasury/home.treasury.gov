The Treasury Department designated two Syrian officials under an authority aimed at financially isolating individuals and entities contributing to Syria's support for designated terrorist groups, its military or security presence in Lebanon, or that are acting for or on behalf of other designated nationals of Syria. For decades, Syria has promoted instability and violence in the Middle East. Even after its withdrawal from Lebanon last year, Syria continues to choose destabilization and support for violence over peace in the region, said Pat O'Brien, Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing. Until Syria takes concrete steps to become a responsible member of the international community, the United States will make known rogue actors supporting the country's destabilizing agenda.

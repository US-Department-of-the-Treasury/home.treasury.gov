**Washington**– The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing[1] for the October – December 2018 and January – March 2019 quarters:

- During the October – December 2018 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $425 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $410 billion.  The borrowing estimate is $15 billion lower than announced in July 2018.  The decrease in borrowing is driven primarily by changes in cash balance assumptions.[2]
- During the January – March 2019 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $356 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $320 billion.

During the July – September 2018 quarter, Treasury borrowed $353 billion in privately-held net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $385 billion.  In July 2018, Treasury estimated privately-held net marketable borrowing of $329 billion and assumed an end-of-September cash balance of $350 billion.2  The increase in borrowing resulted from the higher end-of-quarter cash balance partially offset by higher net cash flows.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 31, 2018.

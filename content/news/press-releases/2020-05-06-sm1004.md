**WASHINGTON**— U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today following the introduction of legislation by U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham and Dianne Feinstein to transfer the U.S. Secret Service back to the Treasury Department:



“I want to thank Senators Graham and Feinstein for introducing this critical legislation to bring the Secret Service back home to the Treasury Department. The Secret Service’s dual mission of conducting complex cyber-enabled financial and counterfeiting investigations and protecting the nation’s executive leadership aligns closely with Treasury’s core national security functions and commitment to the integrity and stability of our financial system. Presidents of both parties, and members of Congress on a bipartisan basis, support returning the Secret Service to Treasury. It will fulfill the recommendations of career and appointed leaders of the Secret Service. This transfer will result in efficiencies that will maximize the Secret Service’s effectiveness and better equip our government to anticipate and counter sophisticated and evolving threats of tomorrow. I look forward to the Senate moving forward to passing this important legislation.”

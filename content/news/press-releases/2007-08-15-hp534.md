The reported division of net purchases of long-term securities between net purchases by foreign official institutions and net purchases   

of other foreign investors is subject to a "transaction bias" described in Frequently Asked Questions 7 and 10.a.4 on the TIC web site.

Net transactions in foreign securities by U.S. residents.   Foreign purchases of foreign securities = U.S. sales of foreign securities to foreigners.

Thus negative entries indicate net U.S. purchases of foreign securities, or an outflow of capital from the United States; positive entries

indicate net U.S. sales of foreign securities.

/8

site describes the scope of TIC data collection.

Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will visit Minneapolis, Minnesota on Tuesday, October 26 to meet with local franchise business leaders to discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. As a result of the President's economic leadership, we have overcome a recession and seen 13 straight months of job creation, totaling more than 1.9 million new U.S. jobs since August 2003, he said.

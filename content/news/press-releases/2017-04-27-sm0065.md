​**Washington, D.C. –**Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin released the following statement on the Financial CHOICE Act: “*As Secretary, I am committed to policies that will ensure sustained economic growth that is driven by Main Street and not held back by Washington. The existing regulatory system is limiting, not stimulating our economy. At the Treasury, we are focused on delivering regulatory relief that encourages banks to provide the capital and liquidity needed to create jobs and opportunities for growth, and that provides protection against taxpayer-funded bailouts. * *I applaud the steady commitment and leadership that Chairman Hensarling and his colleagues have provided on these issues, and welcome the reintroduction of the CHOICE Act. While I continue my work to implement the President’s executive order setting the core principles for financial regulation, I look forward to working with Congress to both support and strengthen our financial system and safeguard taxpayers.*

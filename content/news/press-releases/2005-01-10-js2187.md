The Treasury Department is preparing to say farewell to one of the more dedicated, passionate public servants whom I have had the pleasure to work with. Wayne Abernathy has given generously of his time and his heart for the past two years, serving the Bush Administration extremely well. His leadership in the fight against identity theft, expanding access to financial services, promoting the resilience of the financial sector, and financial education stand out in particular. In each case,Wayneidentified the need for change, worked with his staff on thoughtful solutions, and moved the ball down the field effectively. He has done terrific work here and he will be missed. On behalf of the Department, I wish him all the best in his future endeavors.

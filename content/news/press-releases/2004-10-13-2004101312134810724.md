Secretary John W. Snow is in the St. Louis, Missouri area today, meeting with local business leaders to discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. The President's tax relief is working for the people of Missouri, with more than 2 million taxpayers saving money on their income tax bills in 2004 and 440,000 business taxpayers able to use 2004 tax savings to invest in business equipment and employee compensation, he said. It is critical to make that tax relief permanent, and to continue lifting the barriers to growth in other areas as well – by making health care more affordable, abusive lawsuits more scarce, and energy costs more reasonable.

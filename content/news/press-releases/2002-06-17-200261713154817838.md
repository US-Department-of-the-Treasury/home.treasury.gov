Secretary Paul O'Neill returns to Washington this week from Halifax, Nova Scotia where finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized countries met. The G7 ministers gave a positive outlook on the prospects for global economic growth. The ministers also announced a historic agreement that fulfills President Bush's aim to direct more World Bank funding in the form of grants, rather than loans, for the poorest countries.

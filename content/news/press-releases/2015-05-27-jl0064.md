**WASHINGTON** –The U.S. Department of the Treasury commends the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the steps it took today to sanction Khalil Harb and Muhammad Qabalan.  The two individuals are leaders in the terrorist group Hizballah and have overseen violent operations across the Middle East.   They were designated by the U.S. Treasury Department in August 2013 pursuant to Executive Order 13224.  Today’s step taken by Saudi Arabia reflects the close counter-terrorism and information sharing cooperation we enjoy and look forward to extending further.  The United States will continue to work with partners around the world to combat Hizballah’s activities, both within Lebanon and beyond.

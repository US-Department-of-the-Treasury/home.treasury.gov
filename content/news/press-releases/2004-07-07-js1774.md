Secretary John Snow will visit Portland, ME and Manchester, NH on Thursday and Friday to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. As a result of the President's economic policies, 1.5 million new U.S. jobs have been created since August, said Secretary Snow. Last month, Maine gained 2,100 new jobs and New Hampshire gained 4,600.

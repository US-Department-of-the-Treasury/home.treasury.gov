The U.S. Department of the Treasury today targeted Hizballah's support network by designating the Iran-based Martyrs Foundation, including its U.S. branch, and the finance firm Al-Qard al-Hassan under Executive Order 13224. Two individuals were also designated today for the role they play in Hizballah's support network. We will continue to target those who form the financial backbone of Hizballah, Hamas, PIJ and other terrorist groups that are attempting to destabilize Lebanon and target innocent civilians, said Stuart Levey, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.  We will not allow organizations that support terrorism to raise money in the United States or to evade our measures and continue to operate simply by changing their names.

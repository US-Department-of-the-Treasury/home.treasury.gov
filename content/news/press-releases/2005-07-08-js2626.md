Today's strong employment numbers are a reminder that the American economy is thriving.The unemployment rate is down to 5 percent and more than 3.7 million jobs have been created since May 2003, with more than one million of those in the past six months.This news, combined with a recent report showing that the economy expanded at a 3.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter, illustrate that the fundamentals of our economy are strong and that we are continuing on a positive path of growth and prosperity.President Bush is committed to keeping the economy on the path of healthy growth by making his tax cuts permanent, reducing the burden of frivolous lawsuits, passing a national energy policy, and strengthening Social Security.

Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. supported a recent statement from the multilateral Financial Action Task Force advising financial institutions to seriously weigh the risks posed by Iran's failure to comply with international standards. I commend the FATF for undertaking these actions and for calling upon Iran to urgently address its systemic failures to combat terrorist financing and money laundering, said Paulson.

The numbers published today leave no question that Social Security reform is needed, and it is needed soon. Reform of this system, for the sake of our children, grandchildren and the financial future of our country, is a very real and pressing matter. As the President has continued to say, we can preserve Social Security benefits for current and near retirees and offer great hope to younger workers without raising the payroll tax rate.

Secretary John Snow will appear on CNBC's Kudlow and Company today at 5:45 p.m. EST to discuss the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve Social Security. On Sunday, the Secretary appeared on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, where he said, The President is trying to protect and preserve the system for future generations. The only way to do that that's fair to younger people, that's fair to future generations, is to give them the chance to do better than Social Security will allow them to do. And that requires personal accounts.

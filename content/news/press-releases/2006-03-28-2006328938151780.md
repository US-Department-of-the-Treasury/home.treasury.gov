Treasury Secretary John Snow spoke to the Tax Executives Institute's 56th Midyear Conference in Washington, DC today. Snow discussed the impact of the President's tax policies on the American economy, including recent indications that real labor earnings will be rising over a short period of time. Snow also noted that as we move along toward pro-growth tax reforms, Congress must take action right now to make sure we keep tax rates low. We need to make the President's tax relief permanent, period. Congress especially needs to extend capital gains and dividends tax rates which have been at the center of millions of new jobs, and rising incomes for American families and businesses

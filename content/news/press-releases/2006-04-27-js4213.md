U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Education Dan Iannicola, Jr. will speak at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago on Monday, May 1.  The Treasury officials, U.S. Rep. Judy Biggert and JoAnn Johnson, chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, will also participate in a discussion at the Financial Literacy and Education Commission's regional conference to address the problems faced by the unbanked.

More than 10 million unbanked Americans do not have accounts at mainstream financial institutions, making them more likely to pay extraordinarily high fees for basic services and less likely to save for the future.  Bringing unbanked Americans into the financial mainstream is a key part of the Commission's strategy for financial literacy.

Treasury Secretary John Snow and the Treasury officials recently launched the Commission's national strategy to improve America's financial literacy, available atwww.mymoney.gov.

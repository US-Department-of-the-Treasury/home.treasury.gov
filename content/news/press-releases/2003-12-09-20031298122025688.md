During an interview with CNBC's Maria Bartiromo this week, Treasury Secretary John Snow said that the economy is improving as a result of the President's economic leadership and that, We'll see jobs come with this strong recovery.   The Secretary also reiterated his support for a strong U.S. currency, saying a strong dollar is good for America and that the exchange value of a currency is best set, as I've said, in open, competitive currency markets.  The Secretary also discussed the budget saying, With the stronger growth we're seeing, the government is going to have a lot more revenue coming in and that  President George W. Bush wants to see government spending controlled, and you're going to see that reflected in the '05 budget.

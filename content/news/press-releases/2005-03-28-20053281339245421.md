I was pleased to hear the announcement by my counterpart in Brazil, Finance Minister Antonio Palocci, that Brazil has decided it does not need a new IMF program. This decision reflects the strength of Brazil's economy and of its economic policies. It is terrific news, a hallmark of financial accomplishment for the country, and great credit goes to President Lula for this success. I look forward to continuing our work together in forums such as the U.S.-Brazil Group for Growth to identify policies for increasing prosperity in both of our countries.

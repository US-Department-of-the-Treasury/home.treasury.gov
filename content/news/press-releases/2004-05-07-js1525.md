In the eighth straight month of growth, the economy created 288,000 jobs in April, bringing the total increase since August to more than 1.1 million. The unemployment rate, which is down substantially from its peak last summer, fell in April and is below the average of each of the past three decades.

The longer Americans and American businesses feel the relief of the President’s tax cuts, the more the tide of our economy rises. This is apparent in today’s jobs report as well as in the reading of GDP growth out last week.

The government must ensure that our free market system is as strong and unfettered as possible. The President’s actions to remove weights, like excessive taxation, have provided for needed economic expansion and job growth**.** But more needs to be done to continue on this upward path. The Administration is committed to reducing lawsuit abuse, ensuring an affordable supply of energy and stemming the rising cost of health care. With the President’s leadership, the economy will continue to strengthen and create jobs.

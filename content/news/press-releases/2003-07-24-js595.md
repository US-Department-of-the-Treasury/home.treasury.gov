FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-595

Good morning.

I am very pleased to be here at the Treasury Departments FMS facility on the eve of the printing and mailing of child tax credit checks to more than 25 million hardworking American families.

We are here today of course because of the remarkable leadership of President Bush, whose decisive action is helping us get the economy going again.

President Bush has urged each and every one of us on his economic team to keep working until every American who wants a job can get a job. Getting America back to work is the Presidents number one domestic priority, and its an honor for me to assist him with that goal.

Now that the Presidentjobs and growth act is beginning to take affect, I am confident that we will be seeing more and more of those help wantedsigns across America in the weeks and months ahead.

Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, George W. Bush.

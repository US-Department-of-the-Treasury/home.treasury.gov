Today the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney General, has exercised his authority under the new terrorist financing Executive Order (E.O. 13224) to designate an additional 22 foreign terrorist organizations as specially designated global terrorists. A number of these organizations were previously designated by the Treasury Department as terrorist groups under the 1995 Middle East Executive order.

Designation of these groups under the new Executive Order provides the Treasury Department with enhanced authority to make derivative designations and block assets.

Listing these organizations under the September 24thterrorist financing Executive Order underscores the Administration's objective to disrupt the financial base of terrorists.

Treasury will aggressively investigate the supporters and associates of these foreign terrorist organizations with the intent of listing and blocking the assets of these supporters of terrorism. A listing of these organizations is available at the following web address:

  The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated three Iranian companies supporting Iran's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Kalaye Electric Company, Kavoshyar Company, and Pioneer Energy Industries Company. Treasury is taking this action to deny Iran access to the materials and services that support its nuclear ambitions, said Stuart Levey, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI.)

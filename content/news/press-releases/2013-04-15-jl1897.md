**WASHINGTON **– The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for February 2013.  The next release, which will report on data for March 2013, is scheduled for May 15, 2013.   The sum total in February of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a monthly net TIC inflow of $53.6 billion.  Of this, net foreign private inflows were $44.4 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $9.2 billion.   Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in February – net purchases were $7.6 billion.  Net purchases by private foreign investors were $9.1 billion, and net purchases by foreign official institutions were negative $1.5 billion.   At the same time, U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $25.4 billion.   Taking into account transactions in both foreign and U.S. securities, the net foreign purchases of long-term securities were negative $17.8 billion.  After including adjustments, such as estimates of unrecorded principal payments to foreigners on U.S. asset-backed securities, the overall net foreign acquisition of long-term securities is estimated to have been negative $37.7 billion in February.   Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $14.0 billion.  Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $11.8 billion.   Banks’ own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased by $79.4 billion.   Complete data are available on the Treasury website at:

Includes international and regional organizations /3 The reported division of net purchases of long-term securities between net purchases by foreign official institutions and net purchases of other foreign investors is subject to a "transaction bias" described in Frequently Asked Questions 7 and 10.a.4 on the TIC website. /4 Net transactions in foreign securities by U.S. residents. Foreign purchases of foreign securities = U.S. sales of foreign securities to foreigners. Thus negative entries indicate net U.S. purchases of foreign securities, or an outflow of capital from the United States; positive entries indicate net U.S. sales of foreign securities. /5 Minus estimated unrecorded principal repayments to foreigners on domestic corporate and agency asset-backed securities + estimated foreign acquisitions of U.S. equity through stock swaps - estimated U.S. acquisitions of foreign equity through stock swaps + increase in nonmarketable Treasury Bonds and Notes Issued to Official Institutions and Other Residents of Foreign Countries. /6 These are primarily data on monthly changes in banks' and broker/dealers' custody liabilities. Data on custody claims are collected quarterly and published in the Treasury Bulletin and the TIC website. /7 "Selected Other Liabilities" are primarily the foreign liabilities of U.S. customers that are managed by U.S. banks or broker/dealers. /8 TIC data cover most components of international financial flows, but do not include data on direct investment flows, which are collected and published by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In addition to the monthly data summarized here, the TIC collects quarterly data on some banking and nonbanking assets and liabilities. Frequently Asked Question 1 on the TIC website describes the scope of TIC data collection.

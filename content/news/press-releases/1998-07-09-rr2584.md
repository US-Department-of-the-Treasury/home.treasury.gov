Today, we are closer to creating an IRS where the American taxpayer comes first and customer service is second to none.



Senate passage of the IRS restructuring legislation conference report represents one more step in our continuing efforts to ensure that each and every taxpayer is treated fairly and that the IRS collects our nation's revenue efficiently and effectively.



In addition to important taxpayer protections and critical oversight of the Service, the bill provides much needed tools, such as personnel flexibilities, to help recruit key individuals to lead and manage the IRS restructuring.



We welcome final passage of this bill and look forward to working with Congress to continue the hard work that lies ahead in implementing these reforms.

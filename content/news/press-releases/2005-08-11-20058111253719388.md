In a speech at theSonyTechnologyCenterinMount Pleasant,PennsylvaniaThursday, Treasury Secretary John Snow discussed the strength ofU.S.economy and President Bush's plans to ensure economic growth, job creation and retirement security for future generations. Overall, I'm very pleased to tell you, the American economy is really thriving. We've seen amazing economic times in the last few years. Well-timed tax cuts, combined with sound monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve Board, got our economy moving when we needed it most. They gave individuals more control over their own money, and business like yours the room you needed to grow, and you took over from there. Snow went on to say that health care and energy costs are a concern for the President, and that work to ensure economic growth is ongoing. The job of keeping our economy unencumbered is a never-ending one, indeed. From tax cuts to regulations, we need to work on it every day, and we need to work on keeping it strong for the future, for the long-term.

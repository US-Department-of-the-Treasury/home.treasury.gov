Mr. Chairman, Senator Jeffords, and Distinguished Members of the Committee.

Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the individual alternative minimum tax.The alternative minimum tax, or AMT, is an example of a tax provision that was intended to address a relatively small, targeted problem that has had unintended consequences, grown far beyond its original purpose, and created a far larger problem than it was ever intended to address.Unfortunately, because of the way the AMT is now intertwined with the rest of the individual income tax, a long-term solution to the AMT problem needs to be considered in the broader context of reform of the income tax.

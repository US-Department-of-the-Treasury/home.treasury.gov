The Financial Literacy and Education Commission coordinates financial education efforts through the federal government and maintains a website full of free financial literacy resources at[www.mymoney.gov](http://www.mymoney.gov/). Treasury officials also have been traveling the country to meet with local officials, community leaders and representatives from local businesses to discuss mortgage market issues and help families struggling with their mortgage avoid foreclosure.

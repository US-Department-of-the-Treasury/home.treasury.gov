Today’s employment report clearly demonstrates the positive impact the President’s pro-growth economic policies are having on job creation. The economy added 308,000 jobs in March, the biggest monthly increase in four years, bringing total job growth since August to 759,000. Strength is apparent across the board, including strong job growth in construction, retail and business services.



The President’s tax relief for millions of American families and businesses has reinvigorated the economy and is driving job creation. Economic growth is likely to continue at a robust rate, the manufacturing sector continues to improve, homeownership levels are at an all time high, and American families are keeping more of their hard-earned money in after-tax income.



The President’s leadership will continue to provide the American people with the resources and skills needed to fuel the economic recovery and strengthen this great nation.

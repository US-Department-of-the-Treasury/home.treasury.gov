Treasury Secretary John W. Snow is traveling in Washington state and Oregon this week with the Bush Economic Team: Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao, and Small Business Administrator Hector Barreto. While on the road, the group will be discussing the state of the economy and the President's jobs and growth plan - as well as other efforts by President Bush to create jobs, strengthen the economic recovery and increase workers' standards of living.

During the Jobs and Growth Tour Secretaries Snow, Evans and Chao and Administrator Barreto will participate in town hall-style meetings, roundtables, and tours in the two states, and will meet with families, workers, manufacturers, local business leaders, economic officials, small business owners, and individual investors.

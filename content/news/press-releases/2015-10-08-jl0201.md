​  **LIMA** – U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew met today with French Finance Minister Michel Sapin on the sidelines of the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group. 
Secretary Lew commended Minister Sapin for his continued leadership in helping to find a constructive path forward for Greece within the Eurozone.  He noted the importance of the Greek government meeting its reform commitments in a timely manner and for Europe to follow through on its commitment to put Greece’s debt on a sustainable path.  
Secretary Lew also discussed the important progress Ukraine has made in advancing economic reform and debt restructuring, with the support of the United States, Europe, and its international partners. 
Secretary Lew stated that the recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Climate Policy Initiative report shows that in 2014, six years before the 2020 goal, climate finance from developed to developing countries reached $62 billion.  Secretary Lew noted that this is significant progress toward the $100 billion goal and will help build confidence that climate finance is flowing and continues to increase.  
Secretary Lew also discussed the Iran agreement and emphasized that Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) sanctions relief will not begin until Iran has verifiably fulfilled its commitments under the JCPOA, which subjects Iran to unprecedented inspections and cuts off all pathways for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon.

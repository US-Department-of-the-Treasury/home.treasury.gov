Over 215 years ago, the founders of our nation gathered on July 4, boldly declaring independence from oppression. These great leaders envisioned a unified nation, which upheld equality and liberty for every one of its members. The founders

envisioned a powerful nation, with powerful ideas to lead the world. During the past nine months since September 11th, I have watched our leaders and our people come together to show this same courage.

As the American people gather with family, friends and neighbors, this courage and unity has a refreshed value. We remember the words of President George W. Bush, who said on September 11th, This is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace . . . None of us will ever forget this day. Yet, we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.

This Fourth of July, I urge everyone to celebrate not only the power of our nation, but the power of the human spirit which created and defended the values of democracy. Have a safe and happy holiday.

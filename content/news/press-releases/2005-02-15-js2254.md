Today's formation of the Financial and Economic Literacy Caucus is an important step in the federal effort to promote personal economic security through financial education.I commend Representatives Judy Biggert and Ruben Hinojosa for their efforts to provide Americans with the education resources they need to achieve their financial goals.I look forward to partnering with the caucus to advance Treasury's commitment to ensuring that Americans learn more about their finances and, in so doing, live better lives.

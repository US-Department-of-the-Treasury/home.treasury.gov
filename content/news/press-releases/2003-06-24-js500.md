FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-500



I would like to convey the sadness that everyone in the United States Treasury Department feels on learning of the loss of LaToya Taylor.  Ms. Taylor was a dedicated mother and public servant, and her passing is all the more heartbreaking for coming so early in her career.  Our sincere condolences go to her family on this day.

Speaking to a group of Manchester, NH business owners yesterday, U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow relayed some of the economic benefits of tax relief for the State of New Hampshire. While tax day is never a day that Americans look forward to, it's always nice when a good plan comes together; and I am delighted to be here, almost three years since the President signed the Jobs & Growth Act, to discuss the fact that because of the tax relief, New Hampshire's economy is strong, Snow said.  In fact, the unemployment rate here in New Hampshire is at 3.5 percent, which is a significantly lower rate than the state experienced in both the 80's and 90's.  And it's also one of lowest unemployment rates in the country.

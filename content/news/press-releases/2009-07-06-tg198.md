**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced that Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey will travel to China and Hong Kong on Monday to further the Administration's efforts to prevent North Korea from advancing its nuclear and missile programs.  Under Secretary Levey will meet with senior government officials and private sector executives July 8 – 10, 2009 to discuss the shared interest among nations in protecting the integrity of the international financial system by preventing North Korea from misusing that system to buy and sell dangerous technology in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions and to engage in other illicit conduct.

Under Secretary Levey will seek to build on a history of strong international cooperation on these issues and to amplify efforts currently underway to mitigate the increased risk that North Korea and North Korean entities pose to the international financial system and financial institutions worldwide.

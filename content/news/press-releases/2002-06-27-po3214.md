I applaud House Speaker Dennis Hastert for bringing to the floor legislation to increase the statutory debt ceiling.  The bipartisan House Members who voted for this legislation heeded the President's call to put politics aside and did the right thing for the country.  They stood up for the soundness and strength of the American economy and preserved the full faith and credit of the United States Government.

FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-880

I salute the leadership of Chairman Rainer and Chairman Levitt in reaching this agreement.

This agreement should make it possible for Congresss to enact legislation that will maintain the competitiveness of American financial markets, reduce systemic risk, and create much needed legal certainty for over the counter derivatives market.

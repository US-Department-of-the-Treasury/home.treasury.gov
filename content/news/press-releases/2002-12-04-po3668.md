Deputy Secretary Dam will travel to Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and Peru, December 7-14.

In high-level meetings with a wide array of senior government officials and private sector political, financial and economic experts, Dam will discuss issues affecting the common interest of the United States and the region; particularly development efforts - such as investing in people through education and water projects, regional stability, capital market development, and our continued cooperation on law enforcement and money laundering efforts.

This is Dam's second trip to South America.  In November 2002, Dam traveled to Brazil to attend a World Economic Forum summit on Latin American business in Rio de Janeiro.

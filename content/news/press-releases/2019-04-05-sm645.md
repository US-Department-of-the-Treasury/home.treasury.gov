Secretary Mnuchin
“President Trump made an excellent choice when he nominated David Malpass to serve as President of the World Bank Group, and we’re pleased that he was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors. As Under Secretary for International Affairs at the Treasury Department, David played an important leadership role in development policy, supporting international debt transparency and encouraging reforms at the Bank that would help raise living standards in the world’s poorest countries. All this makes him an ideal fit to lead the World Bank, and I look forward to working with him in his new capacity.”

“Congratulations to David Malpass on his unanimous election as World Bank President. He will be an extraordinary leader of the World Bank. I look forward to continuing our work to economically empower women globally and further the Bank’s core mission of ending poverty.”

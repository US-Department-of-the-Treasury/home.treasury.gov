JS-705

As a result of the Presidents leadership, the recession has ended, our economy is beginning to recover, and we are seeing positive signs.  But, todays unemployment numbers mean we need to do more to strengthen the environment for job creation. This Administration wont be satisfied until every American who wants to work can find a job.  That is why we are working so closely with Congress to implement the Presidents specific steps to build employer confidence and create momentum to hire new workers.

**WASHINGTON** – Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker begins a trip to Southeast and South Asia today.  Over the next eight days, Under Secretary Mandelker will engage high-level government officials in Malaysia, Singapore and India, as well as private sector and industry stakeholders to discuss shared efforts to counter illicit financial threats that could compromise the integrity of the global financial system.

The trip will include discussions with counterparts at the Ministries of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Central Banks, and other agencies, on issues such as:

- U.S. nuclear related sanctions on Iran, and the global coalition to combat Iran’s state support for terrorism and ongoing malign behavior;
- Shared efforts on countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) more broadly, and efforts to guard against money laundering through better coordination with partners.

Ed has served with distinction as the top legal official at the Treasury Department. In the beginning of my tenure as Treasury Secretary, Ed played a crucial role in the negotiations that resulted in the successful Mexican financial assistance program. In 1996, his legal advice helped this country avoid defaulting on its obligations during the debate with Congress about extending the debt limit. He also represented Treasury ably on the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS and was critically involved in designing the support package for Brazil last year.



Treasury is faced on a daily basis with many legal challenges that are critical to the success of the department, and Ed and his legal team met those challenges with great success. I appreciate his service to the department and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors.

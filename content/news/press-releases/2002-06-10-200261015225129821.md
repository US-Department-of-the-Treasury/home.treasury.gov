Federal officials last month captured a U.S. citizen with suspected ties to al Qaeda who allegedly planned to build and explode a radioactive dirty bomb in the United States, the Bush Administration announced today. The Customs Service provided material assistance to the FBI, which led to the arrest of Jose Padilla as he flew into O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, from Pakistan. Secretary O'Neill today praised the Customs Service for their role in defending American families from and disrupting yet another potential terrorist attack. The Customs Service is credited with foiling the Millennium Bomber attack on Los Angeles International Airport in 1999.

Deputy Secretary Kimmitt travels to Japan and South Korea this week to continue consultations on the International Compact with Iraq. The Compact is an initiative launched by the UN and Iraq, to help Iraq realize its vision of a stable and prosperous nation underpinned by a self-sustaining economy. The Compact will embody commitments by Iraq on a plan to achieve economic self-sufficiency in return for international support during this period of economic reform and transition.



We commend Iraq for its commitment, as part of this Compact, to take a series of steps to achieve objectives in economic and reconstruction areas, said Deputy Secretary Robert M. Kimmitt when the Compact was launched. Kimmitt led a U.S. delegation to Kuwait City last week for a meeting on the Compact with Iraqi officials and representatives from 20 countries and regional and multilateral institutions, including the UN, IMF and World Bank.

Thank you. I look forward to working closely with Chairman Mack on this worthwhile task to find ways to reform and simplify our tax system. Someone once said that tax simplification is complicated stuff. I agree, but I believe that we have an excellent opportunity to meet this challenge. To accomplish any significant change, it is vital that it be done on a bipartisan basis. I am pleased that the President assembled this panel to begin the process of working together to reform our tax system.

Washington
– The passage of the United States-Canada-Mexico Agreement (USMCA) in the Senate today is a testament to Ambassador Lighthizer and the rest of the U.S. negotiating team’s steadfast commitment to advancing President Trump’s trade agenda. This historic agreement not only modernizes and rebalances our trade relationship with Canada and Mexico, but it promotes economic growth, creates jobs, and provides crucial certainty for farmers, workers and manufacturers. This deal fulfills yet another promise made by President Trump to negotiate fair and reciprocal trade deals, and will help to deliver continued economic growth and prosperity for all Americans.

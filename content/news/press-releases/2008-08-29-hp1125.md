Preliminary data from an annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2007 are released today and posted on the U.S. Treasury web site at ([http://www.treas.gov/tic/fpis.html](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis)). Final survey results, which will include additional detail as well as revisions to the data, will be reported on October 31, 2008.



The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.



A complementary survey measuring foreign holdings of U.S. securities also is conducted annually. Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held on June 30, 2008, are currently being processed. Preliminary results are expected to be reported on February 27, 2009.



Overall Preliminary Results



The survey measured U.S. holdings at year-end 2007 of approximately $7.2 trillion, with $5.2 trillion held in foreign equities, $1.6 trillion in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities. The previous such survey, conducted as of year-end 2006, measured U.S. holdings of $6.0 trillion, with $4.3 trillion held in foreign equities, $1.3 trillion in foreign long-term debt securities, and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.

The stock of foreign securities for December 31, 2007 reported in this survey may not, for a number of reasons, correspond to the stock of foreign securities on December 31, 2006, plus cumulative flows reported in Treasury's transactions reporting system. The final report on U.S. holdings of foreign securities as of end-year 2007 will contain an analysis of the relation between the stock and flow data.

**LONDON --**We are honored to have been appointed by President Obama as Special Representatives for the United States to the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue. The Dialogue is a result of an agreement reached between the United States and China by President Barack Obama and President Hu Jintao.   The dialogue will focus on addressing the challenges and opportunities that both countries face on a wide range of bilateral, regional and global areas of immediate and long-term strategic interest. Through the Dialogue, and in its strategic and economic tracks, we look forward to pursuing in-depth discussions with our Chinese counterparts to enhance the welfare of the citizens of both countries. We intend to meet once a year in alternate capitals, and we look forward to welcoming the Chinese to the United States for the first round of the Dialogue this summer.   We look forward to working closely with our respective Chinese Co-Chairs, Chinese State Councilor Dai Bingguo, and Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan, as well as our colleagues in President Obama's Cabinet in promoting U.S.-China cooperation.   ###​

President Bush announced a plan today to stabilize auto makers by drawing from the financial rescue package Congress approved earlier this year. Automotive companies receiving loans will have to establish plans for long-term viability by March 31 or be required to repay their loans in full. In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession, allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action, the President said.

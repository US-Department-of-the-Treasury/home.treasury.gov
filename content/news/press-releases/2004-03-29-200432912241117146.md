Secretary John Snow is in Cincinnati, OH today to meet with local business leaders. He will meet with employees from Kroger and speak to members of the Cincinnati Business Committee. In his discussions, Secretary Snow will highlight the importance of tax cut permanency and free trade, and how both are critical for economic and jobs growth. The Administration's tax policies have led to lower income tax for more than 4.4 million Ohio taxpayers, and Ohio-made products are sold around the world.

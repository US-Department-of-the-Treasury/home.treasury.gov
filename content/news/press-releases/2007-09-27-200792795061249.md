Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. speaks today at two events focusing on the importance of addressing climate change. He'll deliver remarks at the Major Economies Meeting, convened by President Bush, bringing together 18 of the world's major economies and the United Nations. Paulson is also participating in a panel discussion in New York Thursday morning to discuss economic growth in the face of resource scarcity and climate change. The future will be built by leaders who recognize that economic growth and responsible environmental stewardship are not incompatible, said Paulson.

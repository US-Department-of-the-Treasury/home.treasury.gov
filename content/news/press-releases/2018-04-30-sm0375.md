**WASHINGTON** -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of privately-held net marketable borrowing[1] for the April – June 2018 and July – September 2018 quarters:

- During the April – June 2018 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $75 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $360 billion.  The borrowing estimate is $101 billion lower than announced in January 2018.  The decrease in borrowing is driven primarily by the higher end-of-March cash balance combined with the higher cash surplus during the quarter.2
- During the July – September 2018 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $273 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $350 billion.

During the January – March 2018 quarter, Treasury borrowed $488 billion in privately-held net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $290 billion.  In January 2018, Treasury estimated privately-held net marketable borrowing of $441 billion and assumed an end-of-March cash balance of $210 billion.[2]  The increase in borrowing was attributable to a higher end-of-quarter cash balance partially offset by higher receipts and lower outlays.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, May 2, 2018.

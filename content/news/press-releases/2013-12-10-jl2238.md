“I am pleased that the Senate today confirmed Representative Mel Watt as director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  His many years of private sector experience and as a Member of the House Financial Services Committee will serve him well as he works to bolster the housing sector and modernize housing finance.  He has a distinguished and proven record of building bipartisan support to protect consumers, rein in deceptive mortgage lenders, and expand economic opportunity for hard working Americans.  Mel knows what it takes to strengthen the economy and middle class, and I look forward to working with him as we continue our efforts to reform the housing finance system, help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages and boost the recovering housing market.”

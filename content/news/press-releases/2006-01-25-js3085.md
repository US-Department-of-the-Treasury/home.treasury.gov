 In a ceremony at the Department of the Treasury this morning, Secretary John Snow signed a statement of support that joined the Treasury Department with other employers by pledging the following:

1. Employment will not be denied because of service in the Guard or Reserve;2. Employee job and career opportunities will not be limited or reduced because of service in the Guard or Reserve;3. Employees will be granted leaves of absence for military service in the Guard or Reserve, consistent with existing laws, without sacrifice of vacation; and4. [The] agreement and its resultant policies will be made known throughout the organization.



It is with great respect for the National Guard and Reserves that I sign this Statement of Support, Secretary Snow said. As civil servants, I believe we should all be humbled to work alongside the men and women who are giving twice to their country – first by serving in the Federal Government and second by volunteering for the ultimate in service, the defense of our great nation and all its precious freedoms. I am proud to affix my signature to a document that makes official my heartfelt support, and deep support from the Treasury, of these valiant federal employees.

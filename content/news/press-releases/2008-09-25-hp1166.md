Dear friends, I am honored to be here today to host this Iftaar at the Treasury Department.



I know that Ramadan is a special time of year for Muslims, and I am pleased that you have chosen to join me for an Iftaar.It is an opportunity for Treasury to thank and honor you all for the many contributions you make to the American economy and to America's place in the rest of the world.America is extremely diverse, and we treasure that quality.You represent the best that is America, and are integral to our nation's vitality, prosperity, and growth.



Ramadan represents a time ofspecial devotion to family, to kindness and to charity.With this in mind, I would like to highlight the Department of the Treasury's effortsto engage with both the charitable sector and affected communities to advance our mutual interests in a free, open, tolerant and charitable society: one that encourages charitable and humanitarian activities, while at the same time protecting those efforts from abuse.



Providing effective and safe delivery of charitable services in regions at high risk for illicit finance activities may require creating alternative distribution mechanisms.Such distribution outlets are achieved through global, charitable partners supported by the U.S. Government.The aim is straightforward - to provide a safe and effective way for individuals to contribute into critical regions, where aid is desperately needed such as the West Bank and Gaza.Such partnerships also aim to weaken the hold that terrorist organizations have on vulnerable populations by harnessing a competitive force – the generosity of the American people.



Under the leadership of Dr. Ziad Asali, the American Charities for Palestine (ACP) and USAID are doing just that through their recent partnership established in August of this year.ACP, a U.S. non-profit organization, raises funds from the American charitable sector and donor communities and transfers these funds to USAID in order to finance specific projects in health care and education that USAID is administering in the PalestinianTerritories.It is our hope that this type of collaboration will take root and serve as a model for other areas of concern, as well as encompass other funding streams including that of the international community.



In addition to our efforts in protecting the integrity of giving, the Treasury Department is actively engaged in promoting investment and economic development in the PalestinianTerritories.In May 2008, President Bush asked me to lead a Presidential delegation, which included Dr. Asali and also Rob Mosbacher, President and CEO of OPIC, who are with us this evening, to join President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad at the Palestine Investment Conference in Bethlehem.This conference was truly a historic and groundbreaking event.During my trip to the region, I discussed the importance of developing a vibrant, healthy private sector and urged the Palestinian Authority to continue to improve the climate for business.



The Treasury Department supports other U.S. Government initiatives to promote investment in the Palestinian economy.Last December, for example, President Bush and Secretary Rice formally launched the U.S.-Palestinian Public Private Partnership, which is led by my friend and colleague Walter Isaacson, who heads the Aspen Institute.The Partnership is developing quick-impact projects to promote job creation in the West Bank, including establishing an Arabic-language call center and five youth development and resource centers designed to prepare youth for full and productive participation in the Palestinian society and economy.By building a vibrant economy in the PalestinianTerritories that is led by the private sector, we will help improve the lives of people, enhance stability, and bolster prospects for lasting peace.



Our goal with these initiatives is to enhance the humanitarian, financial, and economic relationships with Muslim communities here and around the world.We appreciate that, as members of the global community, we all stand to benefit from greater coordination, cooperation, and mutual respect – understanding the world we live in, and contributing to that world in the best way we can.



In this spirit, I look forward to continuing our work together, and am proud of the progress we are achieving.I especially thank you for your participation, compassion, and leadership in moving this dialogue forward.



I thank you again for coming to the Treasury Department today and Ramadan Kareem.

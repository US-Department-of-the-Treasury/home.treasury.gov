**​ View the Sources and Uses table here Washington, D.C.  --**The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of net marketable borrowing for the October – December 2012 and January – March 2013 quarters:

- During the October – December 2012 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $288 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $60 billion.  This borrowing estimate is $29 billion lower than announced in July 2012.  The decrease in borrowing relates to lower outlays, higher receipts, and changes in the cash balance assumptions.
- During the January – March 2013 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $342 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $30 billion.

During the July – September 2012 quarter, Treasury issued $264 billion in net marketable debt, and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $85 billion.  In July 2012, Treasury estimated $276 billion in net marketable borrowing and assumed an end-of-September cash balance of $60 billion.  The decrease in borrowing was driven by higher-than-projected receipts—primarily due to Treasury's sale of American International Group common stock—and lower-than-projected outlays, partially offset by changes in the cash balance assumptions.[1](#ftn1)

Additional financing details relating to Treasury's Quarterly Refunding will be released at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 31, 2012.

The purpose of my visit toIraqhas been to discuss economic and financial issues of interest to the United StatesandIraq.I have had very successful meetings with the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, and the Central Bank Governor.I would like to thank the Minister of Finance for hosting a wonderful lunch at his residence.His hospitality is a testament to the strong friendship and cooperation that has developed between the Finance Ministry of Iraq and the U.S. Treasury.

My visit toIraqcomes just nine days after the historic and successful elections for the National Assembly, and I note and can see that confidence and optimism from the elections has also spread to the economic sphere. Indeed, there is a great deal to be optimistic about.

The progress made is especially remarkable when compared to the conditions during my visit here in June 2003.Then the old Saddam dinar was in circulation, the central bank could not operate independently and did not have any reserves, and the country suffered under a huge debt burden.

In contrast, today inIraqwe see the necessary foundations for a strong and vibrant economy are being established.Notable successes over the past year include: the successfully launching of a new currency, an 80 percent reduction onIraq's sovereign debt, and the establishment of an independent central bank law.

One of the topics for discussion today was the newly opened income-earning account that the Central Bank ofIraqestablished at the Federal Reserve Bank ofNew York.This account will enable the Central Bank ofIraqto increase its earnings by about $100 million per year. This income can be used by the Central Bank to improve its infrastructure and enhance the services provided to the financial sector and the Iraqi people.Much work remains to be done on the development of the banking sector, but the people of Iraq are right to be optimistic for their future following the election, for the necessary economic and political foundations are taking root to ensure Iraq's prosperity.

JS-1551

  

Today the House of Representatives acted on a measure that is solid common sense for America's working families. I applaud their vote to prevent a tax increase on the nearly 94 million people who benefit from the lowest 10% bracket.The Senate should quickly follow suit. Preventing a tax increase is essential for taxpayers at all income levels, especially those in the lower 10% bracket. The President is committed to allowing hard-working individuals and families keep more of their own money to help pay for their children's education, invest for retirement, and spend as they see fit.This action will bring greater fairness and simplicity to the tax code.

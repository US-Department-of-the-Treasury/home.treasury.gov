​ **WASHINGTON** – “I am pleased to formally announce our decision to support Christine Lagarde to head the International Monetary Fund for a second term.    “I’ve known Christine for many years, and I’ve seen time and again her ability to bring people together on major global issues and drive toward solutions.    “Christine Lagarde has done an exceptional job leading the IMF for the last five years, guiding the Fund at a critical time for the global economy.  I look forward to continuing to work with her as she directs the Fund’s vital work.  As in 2011, we are encouraged by the broad support she has secured among the Fund’s membership, including from the emerging economies.”   ###

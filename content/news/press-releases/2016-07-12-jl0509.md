​**Remarks by Treasury Secretary Lew at Joint Press Availability with French Finance Minister Michel Sapin**

**PARIS** – I would like to thank Minister Sapin for hosting me here today.  The United States and France have long maintained a strong friendship and important economic partnership and the European Union remains an indispensable partner for the United States in stimulating economic growth and addressing regional and global challenges. That will remain so for many years to come.

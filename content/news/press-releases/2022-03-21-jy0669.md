KINSHASA — Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson traveled to Kinshasa, DRC this week as the last stop on his three-country visit to Africa. While in Congo he met with senior officials, including President Felix Tshisekedi, to discuss efforts to fight corruption, counter the financing of terrorism, enact systemic AML/CFT reforms, and disrupt the illegal mining trade.

On Thursday in Kinshasa, Under Secretary Nelson announced[new Treasury sanctions](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0664)on Alain Goetz, a Belgian national who operates a network of companies involved in the illegal gold trade that fuels armed conflict and deprives the Congolese people of resources and revenue.

President Biden has identified combatting corruption at home and abroad as a key national security priority. Under Secretary Nelson’s visit builds upon recent high- level administration visits to the country and underscores the strong partnership between the U.S. and the DRC in the fight against corruption. To that end, in addition to President Tshisekedi, he also met with Prime Minister Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde, Minister of Finance Nicolas Kazadi, Minister of Justice Rose Mutombo Kiese, Central Bank Governor Malangu Kabedi-Mbuyi, CENAREF Executive Secretary Adler Kisula, Inspector General of Finances Jules Alingete Key, and Agency for the Fight Against Corruption Director Thierry Mbulamoko.

Additionally, Under Secretary Nelson hosted roundtables with civil society and the Congolese Bankers Association to hear their perspectives on reform efforts.

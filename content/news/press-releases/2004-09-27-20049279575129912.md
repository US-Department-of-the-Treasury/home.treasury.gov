Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will be in Reno, Nevada on Tuesday, September 28 to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. As a result of the President's economic leadership, we have overcome a recession and seen 12 straight months of job creation, totaling 1.7 million new U.S. jobs since August 2003, said Secretary Snow.  Nevada has gained more than 31,000 new jobs so far this year, and the President's tax reform policies have ensured that 845,000 Nevada taxpayers will have lower income tax bills in 2004.

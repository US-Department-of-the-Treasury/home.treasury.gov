These letters are the first step in an extensive outreach effort Treasury and the IRS will be leading over the weeks ahead to inform qualified Americans how to get their stimulus payment.



For the majority of Americans, all they will need to do is file a tax return.The IRS is working closely with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Social Security Administration, Members of Congress, AARP, and other groups to reach those who do not normally file a return and ensure they know how to get their stimulus payment this year.

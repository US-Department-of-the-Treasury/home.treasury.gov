“Today’s agreement between Greece and its creditors is an important step forward. The agreement provides a basis for restoring trust among the parties and creates the conditions for a path forward for Greece within the Eurozone, which is in the best interests of Greece, Europe and the global economy. It underscores Greece’s commitment to make deep and difficult fiscal and structural reforms, and reflects a commitment by its creditors to provide financial support and help create a path for Greece to return to growth, and achieve debt sustainability. These pledges will require difficult steps by all of the parties and substantial work remains to be done. The United States will remain engaged with all parties in this important period.”

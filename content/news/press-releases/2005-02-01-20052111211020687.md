Secretary Snow praised a proposed $500 million increase for IRS enforcement activities, included in President Bush's 2006 budget request. Americans who play by the rules and pay their taxes deserve confidence that others pay their fair share as well, he said. The vast majority of Americans pay their taxes.  The IRS is committed to striking a balance between catching those who would avoid paying and providing excellent service to all taxpayers.

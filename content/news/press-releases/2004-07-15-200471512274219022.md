President Bush today took another important step in the fight against identity theft, the fastest growing financial crime in America. This new law will increase penalties for identity thieves and ensure that those who do the crime will do the time. By empowering consumers, law enforcement and American businesses with new ways to fight ID theft, and with the ongoing vigilance of individuals to protect their personal information, we are one step closer to putting an end to this despicable crime.

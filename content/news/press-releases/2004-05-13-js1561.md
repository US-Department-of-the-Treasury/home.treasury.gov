Today I would like to discuss the economic component of our foreign policy engagement with Japan.I believe that there have been important changes in this engagement during the Bush Administration, and that these changes are already beginning to show tangible results.

I am very impressed with how the Kyoto-StanfordCenter has created new substantive person-to-person, business-to-business engagements between the United States and Japan.The internships of Stanford engineering and computer science students at Japanese high-tech firms and the small candid seminars given by Japanese professors here at the Center are examples of these engagements.

The recent improvements in economic relations between the governments of the United States and Japan are based on similar substantive, candid engagements, from the very top political level – meetings between President Bush and Prime Minister Koizumi – to the technical expert level – such as the roundtable meeting I had yesterday at the Bank of Japan.

Let me begin with the economic situation in Japan at the start of the Bush Administration, three and a half years ago.Growth in Japan was near zero, even negative, much as it had been for the previous ten years – a period many economists had called the “lost decade” in Japan.Even worse, Japan was plagued by a corroding deflation that had persisted for more than six years.The deflation was holding back economic growth because both consumers and businesses curtailed their spending plans, anticipating even lower prices in the future.This deflation and lack of growth made it difficult for people to service their loans and, as a result, bad loans (nonperforming loans) at banks began to grow and threaten the banking system.

A Japan in economic stagnation was clearly not in the interests of the United States.Japan is an important ally.Its growth would benefit the United States and the world economy.Its growth would provide the resources to help Japan play a key role with the United States and other allies in providing security and development assistance for emerging and developing economies.So, the lagging economy in Japan was a problem that President Bush and his Administration wanted to help the Japanese solve.After ten years of stagnation, a new approach was needed.

Opportunity for the U.S. to a change its approach was presented by two developments.First, Prime Minister Koizumi was elected to the top leadership position in Japan.Second, a much less notable event, at least for those outside of financial and economic circles, was the announcement by the Bank of Japan that it would follow a new quantitative easing policy to end deflation.This announcement showed a willingness in Japan to take a fresh approach to the economic stagnation problem.(It was an announcement I was particularly pleased to hear as I had been discussing it with Bank of Japan officials even before I came into the Bush Administration.)

Presented with these opportunities, President Bush and his team developed a new approach for our economic relations with Japan.It was based on three principles.

First, the new approach was to have no “Japan bashing.”President Bush provided a clear vision on this point; he wanted our relationship with Japan to be based on friendship.Good friends talk candidly, but they talk as equals.One side doesn’t talk down to the other.Some in Japan and elsewhere were concerned that our relationship with Japan – especially in the economic area – was too antagonistic and too anachronistic.This had to change.

Second, the new approach was to focus more on monetary issues and less on fiscal issues.From a technical economic view, one could say it was less Keynesian, though there was nothing doctrinaire here.In our view – and the recent BOJ announcement confirmed this – the excessive government spending and deficit creation (one Keynesian stimulus package after another) were not helping the deflation situation.Instead of fiscal stimulus based on government spending, monetary stimulus based on higher growth of the money supply was needed.For monetary policy to be effective in ending the deflation and starting growth it was necessary for the nonperforming loan problem to be addressed, so this became part of our focus on monetary policy.

Third, we focused more on*long run sustainability*of economic growth rather than*short-term fixes*.The zero-growth and deflation in Japan were a multiyear problem, not a multi-month problem.A healthy Japanese economy would be one where the next ten years would reverse the last ten years.

With these three principles in hand, we began our work on implementation.When President Bush met with Prime Minister Koizumi, they talked about these economic issues – including the nonperforming loan problem in Japan.I recall the first senior official meeting in my Washington office with our counterparts from Japan in October 2001.We discussed these issues as well as what actions the U.S. was taking to raise growth, in particular President Bush’s then recently enacted tax cuts.There were many other meetings in the months and years that followed, including several here in Japan with Treasury Secretaries O’Neill and Snow.In each of these meetings and in public speeches, we stressed the three principles underlying our new approach.

I am very happy to say that this new approach is working.We have tangible results.Economic growth in Japan has returned.Experts say it is more*sustainable*than they have seen in a dozen years.Deflation is receding.And all these successes have followed the needed policy changes: increased growth of the money supply and reduction of nonperforming loans.And our Ambassador to Japan says relations between the United States and Japan have never been better!

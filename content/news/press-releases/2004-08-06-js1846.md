Today's employment report shows that the economy continues to move in the right direction. The unemployment rate declined in July to 5.5 percent and we added jobs for the eleventh straight month.The manufacturing sector continues to improve, adding 10,000 jobs in July. With the addition of 91,000 jobs since February, the manufacturing sector has had its best six-month period in six years.

The report is a sign that the American economy is continuing on a path of growth and expansion, and that the President's tax relief continues to givemomentum to that upward path. While this ongoing economic progress is encouraging, we're not satisfied and there is more for us to do. The President's pro-growth policies will keep us on the right track and help us to unleash the full potential of America's economy.

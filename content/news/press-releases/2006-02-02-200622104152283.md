Treasury Secretary John Snow was inPhiladelphia,Pennsylvaniayesterday, where he visited a medical technology firm and delivered a speech at the Greater Philadelphia Investment Conference. The words written by our founding fathers here in this city, without a doubt, created the environment in which innovation, productivity and economic growth could and would occur for hundreds of years to come, Snow said. And no one understands that better than the President. In fact, a lot of what his agenda aims to accomplish is a devotion to the excellent structure that our economy is built on.

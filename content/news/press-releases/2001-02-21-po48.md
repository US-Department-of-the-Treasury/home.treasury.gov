*Joint Release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Department of the Treasury*



The Federal Reserve Board and the Department of the Treasury today announced an extension of the deadline, through May 1, 2001, on their request for comment on whether real estate brokerage and real estate management are activities that are financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity and therefore permissible for financial holding companies and financial subsidiaries of national banks.



A notice of the extension will be published in the Federal Register.

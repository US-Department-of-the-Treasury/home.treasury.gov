As Prepared for Delivery
It is my pleasure to have my first meeting with Minister Caputo.
The Milei administration has inherited a steep stabilization task but has already taken some important steps toward restoring fiscal sustainability, adjusting the exchange rate, and combating inflation.
I commend Minister Caputo for his leadership throughout this period.
There is no doubt that this has been, and will continue to be, a difficult economic transition period for the Argentine people.
Protecting the most vulnerable during this transition will be a challenge, but is vitally important.
I see many areas for collaboration between the United States and Argentina on the topics being discussed in this year’s G20 Finance track, and I look forward to discussing these today with Minister Caputo.
I anticipate an active and constructive relationship between the U.S. Treasury Department and the Ministry of Economy.

  Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. traveled to St. Louis Friday where he toured the facilities of two foreign-affiliated companies operating there to illustrate the importance of open investment in creating jobs and economic expansion in the U.S.  Foreign investment in the United States strengthens our economy, improves productivity, creates good jobs, and spurs healthy competition.   Americans have prospered as foreign companies have put their money to work here, said Secretary Paulson.

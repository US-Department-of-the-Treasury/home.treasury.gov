This morning, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill discussed AGOA and economic growth in Africa at the State Department.  AGOA, formally known as the African Growth and Opportunity Act, was signed into law by President Bush on August 6, 2002. The purpose of the legislation was to help expand trade opportunities and encourage more investment for African countries. Secretary O'Neill, who traveled to four African nations earlier this year, has been aggressively seeking to determine how the people of the United States and the developed world can best help Africans and their elected leaders achieve prosperity.

The President has assured Americans that he will not change the Social Security system in any way for those born before 1950.

Social Security is sound for today's seniors and for those nearing retirement, but it needs to be fixed for younger workers – our children and grandchildren. To keep the promise of Social Security alive for our children and grandchildren, we need to fix Social Security now once and for all.

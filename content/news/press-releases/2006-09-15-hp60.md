The U.S. Department of the Treasury today named two individuals Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) of Syria pursuant to Executive Order 13338, which is aimed at financially isolating individuals and entities that are directly or significantly contributing to Syria's support for designated terrorist groups, or its military or security presence in Lebanon, or that are acting for or on behalf of other SDNs of Syria.

For decades, Syria has promoted instability and violence in the Middle East.Even after its withdrawal from Lebanon last year, Syria continues to choose destabilization and support for violence over peace in the region, said Pat O'Brien, Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing.Until Syria takes concrete steps to become a responsible member of the international community, the United States will make known rogue actors supporting the country's destabilizing agenda.

Major General Hisham Ikhtiyar has been designated for significantly contributing to the Syrian Government's support for designated terrorist organizations, including Hizballah, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ).During his leadership of the Syrian Government's General Intelligence Directorate (GID), Ikhtiyar directed GID activities that significantly contributed to the Syrian Government's military and security presence in Lebanon.

Additionally, the Treasury designated today Brigadier General Jama'a Jama'a, who significantly contributed to the Syrian Government's military and security presence in Lebanon while serving as commander at the Syrian Military Intelligence (SMI) headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon.SMI is the primary entity responsible for coordinating and implementing the Syrian Government's policies in Lebanon.

Today's designation freezes any assets the designees may have located in the United States, and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with these individuals.

Ikhtiyar has served as a senior advisor to Syrian President Bashar al-Asad.Ikhtiyar was the director of the GID from December 2001 until June 2005, when he was appointed by Asad to be director of Syria's Ba'ath Party Regional Command National Security Bureau (NSB).

As the central civilian intelligence service in Syria, the GID conducts surveillance of the Syrian population at large, directs foreign intelligence, and monitors activities in Lebanon.

The NSB coordinates the work of Syria's intelligence agencies, including the GID.The primary mission of the NSB is to formulate strategic political and security recommendations for President Asad.

During Ikhtiyar's tenure as GID director, the GID in Lebanon maintained active informant networks and carried out intelligence operations. Also during Ikhtiyar's tenure in 2004, PIJ was in regular contact with Syrian security organizations in order to secure logistical support. The GID under Ikhtiyar is believed to have provided logistical support to the PFLP-GC.

**Background on Executive Order 13338**

President George W. Bush signed E.O. 13338 on May 11, 2004 in response to the Syrian government's continued support of international terrorism, sustained occupation of Lebanon, pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and missile programs and undermining of U.S. and international efforts in Iraq.Syria's acts threaten the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States.

The Order declared a national emergency with respect to Syria, and authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to block the property of certain persons and directing other U.S. Government agencies to impose a ban on exports to Syria.

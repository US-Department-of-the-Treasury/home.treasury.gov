  **Washington, DC--Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. today issued the following statement on House passage of the Free Trade Agreement with Peru:**Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. today issued the following statement on House passage of the Free Trade Agreement with Peru: 

I commend Chairman Rangel, Congressman McCrery and other House leaders on today's vote. This is an important bipartisan accomplishment. I look forward to working with Congress to secure passage of the other important pending FTAs, each of which incorporates the provisions of the bipartisan May 10 agreement between the Administration and Congress that addressed labor, environmental and other issues.



This bipartisan consensus follows the call we heard from business leaders at the White House this week highlighting how important these agreements are for continued job creation and protecting U.S. investments. Members of Congress from both parties recognize that greater engagement with the world is essential to our growth. The U.S. must continue to seek partners to join us in advancing a global agenda that will help more people realize the benefits of international trade and competition.

The Treasury Department and the Social Security Administration (SSA) today announced an agreement to develop and implement a system by which financial institutions may access a database to verify the authenticity of Social Security Numbers provided by customers at account opening.



Details of the system are still being worked out. The agencies plan to develop a system where checks could be done through online access after the customer has consented to such a check.



Verifying the authenticity of a Social Security Number does not ensure that the person who provided the information is in fact that person. Guidelines would be set to determine what proof of identification would be required by financial institutions.** **

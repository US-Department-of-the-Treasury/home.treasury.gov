The United States and Australia have scheduled the negotiation of a revision to their current income tax treaty. The negotiations are scheduled to begin in Canberra on March 26, 2001. The revision would modify the treaty currently in force between the two countries, which has been in effect since 1983. The two Governments have decided that the current treaty needs to be updated to take into account developments in both countries' tax systems and tax treaty policies.



The Treasury Department invites written comments from the public regarding the upcoming negotiations. Comments on the proposed treaty revision should be sent to Manal Corwin, Acting International Tax Counsel, Room 1000 Main Treasury, Washington, DC 20220, with a copy to Patricia A. Brown, Deputy International Tax Counsel, Room 4224 Main Treasury,Washington, DC 20220. Comments may also be sent by fax to (202) 622-0646, or by e-mail to Manal.Corwin@treasury.gov, with a copy to Patricia.A.Brown@treasury.gov.

Secretary John Snow today said that first quarter 2004 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 4.2 percent illustrates the sustained strength of the economic recovery. The President’s tax relief measures have boosted economic growth and are leading to job creation. In the past seven months, American employers have added more than three-quarters of a million workers to their payrolls. Today’s numbers suggest that America’s economy is poised for long-term growth.

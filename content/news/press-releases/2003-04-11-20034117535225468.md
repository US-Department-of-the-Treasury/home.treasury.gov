Today through Sunday, Treasury Secretary Snow hosts meetings with Central American Ministers, G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors as part of the annual IMF-G7-World Bank Spring Meetings.  In each meeting, Snow will note that economic growth is always at the top of our agenda. In a statement delivered in advance of the meeting Snow said, Economic growth is particularly important at this time when the world economy is falling far short of its potential. To bring about a strong recovery, each of our countries must act decisively to implement strong policies to spur economic growth. The United States has done its part by moving quickly and aggressively to ease both monetary and fiscal policy. The President’s Jobs and Growth program will accelerate the U.S. economic recovery and raise economic growth.

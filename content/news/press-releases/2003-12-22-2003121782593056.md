The U.S. economy next year will grow at its fastest pace since the '90s boom and unemployment will fall, economists surveyed by USA TODAY said this week. In their most optimistic end-of-the-year outlook in years, the economists expect the stock market to continue to rise. And business spending, a key economic element, is expected to rebound strongly after being largely absent. The newspaper surveyed sixty economists Dec. 11-17. For the complete story, go to usatoday.com. Separately, the Associated Press today reported that people are increasingly optimistic about the economy in the next six months and feeling more secure about their jobs, according to the poll conducted for the AP by Ipsos-Public Affairs.

**WASHINGTON** – Consistent with the priority of the Trump Administration to address unfair currency practices, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has provided to the Commerce Department an assessment of currency undervaluation for a pending countervailing duty proceeding.  This assessment is available on the Commerce Department’s public record of the proceeding.

As part of the Commerce Department’s review of countervailing duty claims based on allegations of currency undervaluation, Treasury provides its assessment as to the relevant currency’s valuation, using a framework that facilitates rigorous evaluation of currency valuation and the impact of specific government policies.

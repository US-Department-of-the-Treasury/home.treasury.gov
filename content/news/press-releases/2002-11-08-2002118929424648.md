  At a press conference yesterday, President Bush called for immediate action from the current lame duck Congress to pass legislation creating a Cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security, passage of terrorism risk insurance legislation and passage of the necessary spending bills.  Earlier this fall, Secretary O'Neill said of terrorism risk insurance legislation, which has been delayed on Capitol Hill for months, I think the terrorist risk insurance legislation could have the quickest most profound effect on job creation in our country of anything we could do.  Economists estimate that 300,000 jobs will be created when this legislation is signed into law.

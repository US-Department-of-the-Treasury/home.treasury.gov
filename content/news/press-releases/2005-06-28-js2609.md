JS-2609

I'm encouraged to see that the Senate has now acted on a bi-partisan basis on comprehensive energy legislation that reflects the priorities of the President's 2001 proposal. The passage of this bill is needed to address high energy prices, decrease our dependence on foreign oil, and increase energy efficiency and conservation. Now we need swift action by the House and Senate conference to deliver a bill to the President before the August recess.

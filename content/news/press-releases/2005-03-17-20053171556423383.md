The Treasury Department today released data showing that more than 105 million Americans have a lighter tax bill thanks to the President's tax reform legislation passed in 2001 and 2003. The President's tax relief has resulted in a growing economy that is producing jobs and creating a better standard of living for Americans, said Secretary Snow. Now is the time to make tax relief permanent so that we can extend this period of economic growth and allow families to plan for their future without worrying that their taxes might be raised.

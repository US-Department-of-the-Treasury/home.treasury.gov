Today’s report on industrial production shows robust growth in our nation’s factories.  Manufacturing output increased 0.9 percent in November, the fastest rate of growth since 1999.  The report confirms the improvement suggested by the ISM Manufacturing Index earlier this month.  The gains in factory output were widespread, with increases in the production of both consumer goods and business equipment.  High-tech production increased 4.1 percent and is up 27.5 percent versus last year.  Although more remains to be done, today’s data add to the evidence supporting the wisdom of the President’s economic policies.  Thanks to these policies, businesses have been upgrading their equipment at a rapid pace and the American economy has started creating jobs again.

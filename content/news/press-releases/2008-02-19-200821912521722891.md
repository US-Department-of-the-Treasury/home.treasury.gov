Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. lauded the full HOPE NOW Alliance's adoption of Project Lifeline Tuesday, a targeted outreach initiative to homeowners that are 90-days or more delinquent that may lead to a pause in the foreclosure process. Six servicers spearheaded the effort last week, and with HOPE NOW's support, now more than 90 percent of the subprime servicing market and nearly 70 percent of the entire mortgage market will participate.

MIAMI--Today Treasury Secretary John Snow announced that Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) is identifying ten entities, listed below, that it has determined are owned or controlled by the Government of Cuba or Cuban nationals. These ten include entities organized and located in Cuba as well as entities located in Argentina, the Bahamas, Canada, Chile, the Netherlands, and England. Nine of the ten are travel companies specializing in Cuba travel, and one is a gift forwarder to Cuba.



All property of these entities that is in the possession of persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction is blocked and no persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction may engage in any transactions with these entities unless authorized by OFAC.



OFAC is taking action today in furtherance of President Bush’s October 2003 initiative to strengthen enforcement of U.S. laws prohibiting transactions related to travel to Cuba and to hasten the arrival of a new, free, democratic Cuba. The foreign travel companies identified today provide easy access to Cuba to those U.S. individuals who choose to break the law. Many of these entities use the Internet to advertise and sell Cuban tourism to the U.S. public. U.S. law enforcement officials have intercepted a number of unauthorized travelers whose tour packages were purchased through one of these entities.

**OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROLSTATUS REPORT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ENHANCED CUBA TRAVEL ENFORCEMENT**



Date:  February 9, 2004



On October 10, 2003, President Bush directed the Departments of Treasury and Homeland Security (“DHS”) to step-up enforcement of Cuba embargo travel restrictions by increasing inspections of travelers and shipments to and from Cuba, and by targeting those who travel to Cuba illegally through third countries and by private vessel for illegal business or tourism purposes or to carry unlicensed currency to Cuba.



The Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) reports the following actions and progress to date to fully implement and enforce the President’s initiative.



**Inspection of Cuba Flights **



● DHS committed Bureau of Customs and Border Patrol (“Customs”) to inspecting up to 100% of direct flights at Miami, JFK and LAX for a 90-day period.  After 90 days, the level of future inspections will be reviewed and evaluated.



● OFAC’s staff in Miami, augmented by staff from Washington, worked hand-in-hand with Customs inspectors in Miami during the first 90-day period to provide daily post-October 10 coverage of direct charter flights that depart several times each day for Cuba.



● Since October 10, OFAC has participated with Customs to inspect the weekly charter flights at LAX and JFK twice at each port and we are in direct communication with DHS as questions arise.



● Inspection Activity to Date:



**569 **aircraft with passengers destined for Cuba, mostly direct charter flights, were targeted for outbound inspection.  Over**44,000**passengers were screened as they departed the United States for Cuba and over**50,915 **passengers were screened on their return to the United States on charter flights.



**275**travelers were denied travel on charter flights after examination revealed they did not qualify under any OFAC license category.



**1007**aircraft with passengers returning to the United States from Cuba were targeted for inbound inspections.   This number includes returning charter flights and other flights arriving in the United States from third countries.  Over**50,915 **passengers and crew were subjected to extensive examination.



**376**OFAC-related seizures were accomplished, most of which related to the unlicensed importation of Cuban cigars and alcohol.



**Training **



● Since October 10, OFAC has provided on-site training on Cuba embargo travel restrictions to over**500 **DHS Customs inspectors.  We have accomplished this training on-site in Miami, Los Angeles and JFK, the ports of departure for direct charter flights, and we are now expanding our training efforts to reach Customs inspectors stationed at U.S. Customs Preclearance Facilities in the Caribbean and Canada.  This training will assist inspectors in their efforts to detect illegal U.S. tourist travelers to Cuba.  OFAC has already completed training in Bermuda, Nassau and Aruba.  In the next few weeks, OFAC will provide training to inspectors at**6**Preclearance Facilities in Canada.



In addition to these training sessions, OFAC provides training to Customs inspectors on a monthly basis at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, GA.



OFAC’s Miami Office is working with the Coast Guard to provide Cuba embargo travel training for its personnel.



OFAC fully expects that these training initiatives will result in a significant number of travel referrals from Customs to OFAC for civil penalties.



**Travel Enforcement Investigations **



Civil -



●**264**cases have been opened to date by OFAC’s Enforcement Division for investigation of alleged post October 10, 2003, travel to Cuba.



Criminal -



●**3**cases have been referred for criminal investigation by OFAC Enforcement directly to federal law enforcement agencies, primarily the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  OFAC is working with special agents and Assistant U.S. Attorneys on a number of potential criminal cases.



● On December 4, 2003, OFAC hosted a highly successful meeting in Miami with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Commander of the 7th U.S. Coast Guard District, DHS (ICE and Bureau of Customs and Border Patrol), and Department of Commerce, to coordinate efforts to implement the President’s initiative.  The U.S. Attorney voiced the support of his Office.  It was agreed that working groups from participant agencies will meet quarterly, beginning in March 2004, to review promising criminal cases.  The Commander, USCG 7th District, stated that his organization will (1) redraft the Security Zone Permit to capture the OFAC and Commerce licensing category of the applicant, and will (2) step-up their boarding of pleasure vessels going to and from Cuba.  OFAC agreed to provide Cuba travel training to USCG personnel in South Florida and to implement a feedback program for Customs and USCG to report the status of Cuba travel cases those agencies refer to OFAC for civil penalties.



** Penalties **● OFAC’s Civil Penalties Division plans to expedite action on those violations occurring after the President’s Rose Garden directive to increase enforcement while continuing to issue penalties on currently ongoing cases.-- OFAC’s Civil Penalties Division currently has a docket of nearly 2,000 actions relating to Cuban embargo violations, the majority of which will likely result in monetary penalties paid to OFAC.● Increased Initiation of New Penalty Actions - Since the President’s announcement on October 10th, the Civil Penalties Division has accelerated the issuance of Prepenalty Notices initiating OFAC’s civil penalty cases. By the end of November, all prepenalty notices in the pipeline were issued. Between October 10 and November 30, 2003, OFAC issued a total of approximately**348**new notices opening penalty actions.● Implementation of Expedited Penalty Process - OFAC’s Civil Penalties Division has implemented an expedited civil penalty process.  For all post-Rose Garden announcement violations detected by DHS and referred to OFAC, OFAC’s Civil Penalties Division will initiate appropriate civil penalty action within 60 days of the division’s receipt of DHS’ evidence of violation.  Given the cumulative effect of the enhanced multi-agency enforcement strategy, we anticipate that at least initially an increase of cases by several orders of magnitude will be received in the Civil Penalties Division.-- Major Case Squad Set Up for Cuban Commercial Cases – OFAC’s Civil Penalties Division has set up a Major Case Squad targeting Cuban commercial cases in response to the President’s Rose Garden directive for increased Cuban embargo enforcement.  The Major Case Squad identified cases awaiting OFAC Civil Penalties Division action against banks, companies and other entities involved in commerce with Cuba.  The Squad has contacted more than**60 **violators and informed the majority of them of OFAC’s pending penalty actions against them.  Settlements totaling nearly**$200,000 **have already been reached in**20**of the Major Cases.-- OFAC’s Civil Penalties Division publishes details of penalty settlements and assessments on OFAC’s website.  This information is updated each month.  Penalties settled by and assessed against Cuban travel ban violators appear in the aggregate for informational purposes on the website.● Administrative Law Judges - OFAC now has 3 ALJs in place to hear civil penalty cases and the ALJs have begun issuing orders of hearing to violators.  To date, OFAC has initiated action in cases by forwarding them to the 3 ALJs residing at the Justice Department and the Federal Mine Safety and Health Commission.  Twelve cases are on the ALJs’ docket as the balance has settled their cases with OFAC with penalty payments.  One hundred eleven violators have been given acknowledgments of timely hearing requests along with advisories that orders instituting proceedings before the ALJs will be forthcoming in short order absent settlement of the case.Of these 111 ALJ hearing-noticed cases, 63 violators have already sent in settlement payments with the deadline to pay in the other cases to run in 2 weeks.  Additional settlements are expected.**Other OFAC Actions**



● Licensing Actions –



- OFAC Licensing and Enforcement Divisions have established internal procedures to quickly suspend and investigate allegations of abuse of licenses issued to humanitarian and religious organizations.



- Using information derived from charter flight inspections, OFAC has suspended licenses issued to**2**organizations previously authorized to engage in travel transactions related to humanitarian or religious activities in Cuba.  OFAC is investigating allegations that the licensees may have engaged in activities outside the scope of their licenses.  Four other organizational licenses are under review for possible suspension and investigation.



- OFAC has taken action to limit the number of travel days in Cuba for licenses issued for humanitarian purposes, such as for the delivery of donated goods in Cuba.



● Regulatory / Policy Changes:



- OFAC is working with the State Department to review the current authorization which allows licensed travelers to import up to $100 worth of Cuban origin goods, including cigars and rum, as accompanied baggage.  A revocation of this authorization would result in a significant decrease in U.S. dollars going directly to the state-owned tobacco and alcohol industry.  Revocation would also serve to reinforce the seriousness of the U.S. Government’s Cuba travel enforcement efforts.



**Public Support **



● Calls are regularly received at the OFAC hotline in Miami at**(305) 810**-**5170**to report embargo violations.

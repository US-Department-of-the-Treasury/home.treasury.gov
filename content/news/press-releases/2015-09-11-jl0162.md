**WASHINGTON **– Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew spoke by phone today with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and later with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. 
In the respective calls, Secretary Lew commended the Ukrainian government’s significant ongoing reform efforts to improve the business climate, strengthen governance and competition, tackle corruption, repair the financial sector, and eliminate poorly targeted energy subsidies while protecting the most vulnerable members of society.  Secretary Lew also commended President Poroshenko and Prime Minister Yatsenyuk for their leadership in reaching a debt restructuring agreement that is consistent with the objectives outlined in Ukraine’s IMF program and noted the importance of ratifying the deal in the Rada. 
Secretary Lew added that Treasury continues to encourage creditors subject to the debt restructuring to move swiftly to complete the operation, which will create breathing room for Ukraine to execute its reform agenda and strengthen the groundwork for economic recovery.

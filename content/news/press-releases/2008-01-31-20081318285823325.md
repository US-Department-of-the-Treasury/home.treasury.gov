Secretary Paulson joined Treasurer Anna Cabral, Acting IRS Commissioner Linda Stiff and Chairwoman of the IRS Advisory Council Margaret Roark Thursday in promoting the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as part of EITC Awareness Day. The Earned Income Tax Credit is one of the most successful tools in fighting poverty and helping working families, yet nearly one in four Americans who are eligible do not know they can claim it. EITC Awareness Day kicks off a filing season effort to raise awareness of the EITC through local area partners and Volunteer Income Tax Assistance sites. In the coming months, the Treasury Department and the IRS will continue working with Members of Congress, community leaders and taxpayers to raise awareness of this important tax credit for low-income, working families.

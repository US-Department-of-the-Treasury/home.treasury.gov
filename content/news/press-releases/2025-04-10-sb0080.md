WASHINGTON – On April 14, Secretary of the Treasury Scott K.H. Bessent will travel to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he will engage with both government and private sector leaders to affirm the United States’ full support for Argentina’s bold economic reforms.

During Secretary Bessent’s visit he will meet with President Javier Milei and Minister of Economy Luis Caputo, as well as with other members of Argentina’s government and business community.

Under President Milei, Argentina has conducted policy through actions, not just words. As highlighted by President Donald J. Trump, President Milei has brought Argentina back from economic oblivion. During his meetings in Argentina, Secretary Bessent will reiterate the United States’ firm backing for the continued implementation of President Milei’s robust economic agenda and encourage the international community to fully support President Milei’s economic reform efforts.

“Thanks to the bold leadership of President Javier Milei, the relationship between the United States and Argentina is stronger than ever. I look forward to our positive discussions about Argentina’s economy, and to exploring the ways our nations can further deepen our vital economic relationship” said Secretary Bessent.

Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral recognized Danny Ng with the President's Volunteer Service Award at a ceremony at the U.S. Department of the Treasury Thursday, as part of National Volunteer Week.  Ng is a volunteer with Operation HOPE and has served countless hours empowering youth with basic financial literacy education to take control of their financial future.  In recognizing Danny's volunteer service, we thank him for his willingness to dedicate his time and talents to strengthening our communities and helping our young people, Cabral said.

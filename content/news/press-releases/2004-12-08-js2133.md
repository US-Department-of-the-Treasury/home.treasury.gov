During December 7-8, I met withLiberia's economic leaders, including Chairman Bryant, Finance Minister Lusinee Kamara, Minister for Planning and Economic Affairs, Christian Herbert, and Acting Executive Governor of the Central Bank, Charles Greene.I want to thank Chairman Bryant and his team for their gracious hospitality.I also want to thank Ambassador Blaney, whose tireless efforts have ensured that we inWashingtonare not distracted by events elsewhere in the world.

The U.S. Treasury Department has devoted significant resources to helpingLiberiarecover and grow.In Africa,Liberiais the largest recipient of technical assistance from the Treasury Department because we believe that peace will be sustained only if there is economic growth and job creation.This will require disciplined, transparent and accountable monetary and fiscal policies. That is why we have provided advisors to the Ministry of Finance, the Bureau of the Budget, and the Central Bank. The Treasury Department is also working closely with the IMF, World Bank, and the African Development Bank to create conditions for these institutions to once again provide resources to create jobs and reduce poverty.

The Transitional Government of Liberia has made important progress in restoring growth (expected to be over 20% this year) and improving people's lives.As one example, increased competition in cellular telecommunications has cut costs to consumers significantly.Increased competition in other sectors could lead to similar results.

But I must tell my Liberian friends that, despite some very useful reforms taken by the NTGL and the progress made, there remain too many instances where actions of a few individuals cost the Liberian people dearly and undermine the ability of donors, the IMF and the Multilateral Development Banks to reengage withLiberia.Too many revenues still never make it into the government's budget, particularly from the port.And too much of the money collected continues to be spent outside of agreed budgetary procedures. Government officials must be held accountable for transparent management of public resources.This is important to donors, but even more important to the welfare of the Liberian people.It is their money.

My visit to the Finance Ministry highlighted both the progress that has been made and the work yet to do.A large taxpayers unit is making strides in ensuring that businesses pay their fair share.I observed deliberations of the Cash Management Committee, which was created to ensure that the government spends only the resources it has, does not again run up arrears, and allocates scarce resources to priority areas. However, there continues to be spending that does not conform with the committee's recommendations.

I came because ofLiberia's importance to the United Statesand the unique and special relationship that we share.I came now becauseLiberiais at an important crossroads.Actions in the coming months particularly in the collection and use of public funds -- will determine whether this country, so rich in human and natural resources, achieves its economic potential or slips back to being a failed state.

LS-1091

The Treasury Department today announced that instruments of ratification were exchanged in Washington on December 20, 2000 with respect to a new income tax treaty with Luxembourg. The new treaty, to which the Senate gave advice and consent to ratification on October 31, 1997, replaces an existing income tax treaty between the United States and Luxembourg that entered into force in 1963.

In general, the new treaty will have effect, with respect to taxes withheld at source, for amounts paid or credited on or after January 1, 2001 and, for other taxes, with respect to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2001.

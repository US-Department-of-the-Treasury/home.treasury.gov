U.S. Treasurer Rosario Marin will be in Columbus, OH on Monday, June 23 to formally salute the Ohio Credit Union League’s Latino Financial Literacy Program with an honorary certificate of recognition for its efforts in teaching financial education to Columbus’ Hispanic community. Following the presentation of the certificate, Treasurer Marin will assist in teaching a Spanish-language financial education class where students are learning about saving, managing money and handling credit.

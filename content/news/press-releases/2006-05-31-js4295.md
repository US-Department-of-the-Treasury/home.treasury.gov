**About the New Markets Tax Credit Program**The NMTC Program, established by Congress in December 2000, provides individual and corporate taxpayers with a credit against federal income taxes for making qualified equity investments in investment vehicles known as Community Development Entities (CDEs). Substantially all of the taxpayer's investment must be used by the CDE to make qualified investments supporting certain business activities in low-income communities.  More information on the NMTC program can be found at[www.cdfifund.gov](http://www.cdfifund.gov).

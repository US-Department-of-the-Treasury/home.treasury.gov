I am very pleased to be here to discuss financial and economic developments in Latin America.There has been a lot of good news lately on the economic front in Latin America, and indeed for the global economy as a whole.I would like to discuss some of the reasons for this strong performance and how the United States is working with the countries of the region to sustain it and translate it into substantial reductions in poverty in the coming years.

**Restoring Economic and Financial Stability** When I first started in this job in 2001-2002, the news in Latin America was not so good.Leaders in Argentina struggled to contain an expanding financial crisis, Brazil's high debt levels combined with electoral uncertainties generated growing market concerns, Uruguay's banking system faced a run sparked by the turbulence in Argentina, and Colombia lost market access as investors anticipated imminent fiscal gaps.Of course these difficulties came in the wake of the turbulent 1990s, when Mexico and Brazil experienced full-blown crises of the kind that buffeted emerging markets from EastAsiatoRussia.

Periodic crises and financial market instability in the region have had profound effects in terms of social dislocation and lost economic growth.Firms have scaled back investment and financial markets demanded higher risk premia, discouraging innovation and retarding productivity growth that is the engine of sustained improvements in living standards.The stresses of crisis management also distract policy makers from addressing the critical microeconomic impediments to higher growth.

I am pleased to say that there are no financial crises in the region today.Risk spreads for the region have fallen sharply and remain near their seven-year lows, capital flows have risen, and investment is growing.Foreign direct investment increased by $16 billion last year.I am also pleased to see that there is less contagion.Following Argentina's default at the end of 2001, we did not see a repeat of the contagion that afflicted global capital markets following the East Asia and Russia crises.

Economic growth has responded vigorously.Real GDP for the region as a whole grew almost 6 percent in 2004--the fastest rate in a quarter century.This has translated into millions of new jobs and higher incomes for workers and their families.

What accounts for this turnaround?First and foremost, macroeconomic policies are better.Countries are resisting the tendency to overspend during the fat years.Strong political and economic leadership has enabled countries to improve their fiscal balances to bring down debt levels.Improvements in debt management policies lowered foreign currency-denominated and exchange linked-debt in countries like Brazil and Mexico.Many countries have taken advantage of favorable market conditions to pre-finance a large portion of their obligations coming due in 2005 and build foreign exchange reserves as a cushion against future financial market turbulence.

We have seen a virtual revolution in monetary policy in the region.The last time the IDB annual meetings were in Japan in 1991, regional inflation was raging in the triple digits.In many countries, monetary policies are more focused on price stability combined with either flexible exchange rates or dollarization.During my visits to the region, I have seen first-hand the technical improvements in the operational tools used to conduct monetary and exchange rate policy in countries like Peru and Chile.Dollarized Ecuador enjoyed a sharp drop in inflation last year following several years of inflationary inertia.

These good economic policies have positioned Latin America to seize the opportunities of strong global growth--which, I might add, was also the product of well-timed fiscal and monetary policies in the United States.The rapid export growth we have seen in the region is not just a commodity price phenomenon; export*volumes*were up a robust 11 percent last year.Strong improvements in trade balances led to the second consecutive year with a current account surplus for the region as a whole.

Better policies--defined and implemented by political leaders across the region--have been the key to restoring economic stability and setting the stage for the rapid economic growth we are now witnessing.

At the same time, the United States has played an important role in bolstering these policies and helping countries improve stability through assistance from the international financial institutions.We strongly supported Brazil's IMF program in 2002 to back the solid economic program endorsed by the leading candidates during the lead-up to the presidential elections in the fall.This gave President Lula and his economic team the opportunity to show their leadership, and through a solid economic strategy, pull Brazil back from the brink and lay the basis for the rapid growth and large improvements in indicators of financial vulnerability.Last year Brazil turned in the strongest growth performance in a decade.As Secretary Snow recently noted, Brazil's announcement that it does not need a new IMF agreement represents the hallmark of financial accomplishment.

There are other examples.When Uruguay experienced a run on deposits associated with the crisis in neighboring Argentina, we worked to coordinate an assistance package from the IMF, World Bank, and IDB and provided a short-term bridge loan from Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund to help Uruguayan authorities implement a strategy for halting the bank run and restoring growth.We also backed an IMF program and rapid multilateral development bank assistance for Colombia, when that country faced financial turbulence in 2002 but outlined a solid fiscal program--including important structural fiscal reforms--to stabilize the situation.In Bolivia, we supported an IMF program that has helped the government achieve significant reductions in the fiscal deficit and shore up the financial sector during a period of political uncertainty.

In all of these instances, U.S. and international assistance was used to support good economic policies.Because there was tangible policy progress, the support could have a real confidence-building effect, and it helped the governments quickly restore economic stability and generate a return to robust growth.They are clear examples of the U.S. commitment to Latin America and the Bush Administration's commitment to working closely with the governments in the region to implement policies that improve stability and increase prosperity.

**Sustaining Economic Growth and Reducing Poverty**A focus on microeconomic reforms to clear the way for higher levels of productivity growth is critical to the long-term prospects for the region.Private forecasters are expecting growth of just 4 percent in 2005.The region can do better--it should aim to sustain the 2004 performance.Decades of high growth are needed to bring down the poverty rates that are polarizing societies.

I see two major challenges for turning economic stability into sustained growth.They are, first, institutionalizing the important improvements in macroeconomic policy that have been achieved recently and, second, addressing the business climate problems needed to spur higher productivity growth.

While the fiscal improvements in the last several years have been instrumental to the region's stability and recent growth, continued strong fiscal performance is needed bring down debt levels further and build a stronger buffer against shocks.Overall debt levels are still too high and represent a continued vulnerability for the region.

Countries can do this by institutionalizing structural fiscal reforms in order to lock-in a continued strong fiscal effort.This means improving the efficiency of tax policies--for example, by streamlining complicated systems of rates and exemptions--and strengthening tax administration to reduce evasion.Broadening the tax base and improving compliance produces tax systems that are fairer and allow scope for rate reductions that improve incentives.It means improving the flexibility of public finances by reforming outmoded pension systems and reducing automatic revenue earmarking, so that limited government resources can be channeled to the highest priority uses.

Particularly important for long-term fiscal stability is putting in place strong fiscal responsibility regimes that discipline budget planning and execution, including at the sub-national level where deficit spending and debt accumulation has undermined national governments' efforts at fiscal consolidation.The clearest example here is Argentina, where the provincial overborrowing in the 1990s and the federal government's bailout of the provinces contributed significantly to the country's ultimate default in 2001.

In the area of monetary policy, countries can further bolster the institutional underpinnings of good policy by increasing central bank independence in order to lend greater credibility to their price stability mandates--as countries like Mexico, Chile, and Peru have done.

The other main challenge is to tackle the microeconomic impediments to sustained economic growth.The key to higher growth and living standards is productivity growth, which leads to higher wages and decreases in poverty.However, productivity growth in Latin America has been far too low, especially when compared with the productivity growth that has enabled such large reductions in poverty that we have seen in East Asia.As the IDB points out in its "The Business of Growth" study, Latin America's productivity growth averaged only 0.7 percent of GDP in the 1990s, compared to 1.7 percent in developed countries and 2.7 percent in East Asia.

The reasons for this disappointing performance are clear.Low trade integration with the rest of the world--total trade was only 45 percent of the region's GDP, compared to nearly 80 percent in East Asia--rigid labor markets, weak property rights and judicial systems, and lack of access to credit particularly for small businesses all hold the region back.

As a result of these distortions, a disproportionately high share of the region's economy operates in the informal sector.According to the World Bank's "Doing Business" survey, the informal sector accounts for 42 percent of the region's gross national income, compared to 24 percent in East Asia and 17 percent in the OECD countries.This is hugely inefficient, as fewer new businesses are created, and the firms that do exist are less likely to expand, hire more people, and become engines of growth.Resources are wasted evading overly burdensome regulations, and tax bases are overly concentrated and narrow.According to the World Bank's indicators, the 70 days in Latin America is the longest amount of time to start a business in any other region of the world.

We know the agenda that must be pursued to address the impediments to higher productivity growth.It basically involves attacking the problems that prevent investors from risking their capital.Markets for products, labor, and capital have to be open and competitive.Governments and the private sector have to invest in high-return projects to build infrastructure and widen access to education.Property rights have to be protected.And citizens have to be protected from corruption.Experience in this region and elsewhere shows that, when these elements are in place, entrepreneurs will invest and create jobs.

**U.S. Commitment to  Latin America** Just as the United States has played a strong leadership role in assisting the region through its difficulties of the last several years, we are committed to helping translate the current economic recovery into the sustained growth that the region is capable of.

As I described earlier, trade has played a significant role in the recent strong economic performance in the region.The United States continues to advance an ambitious agenda for reducing barriers to trade in this hemisphere, so that trade can continue to serve as a driver of economic growth for years to come.The free trade agreements (FTAs) that we have concluded or are in the process of concluding will cover 90 percent of U.S. trade with the region.These include the U.S.-Chile FTA, the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) as well as Panama and the Andean region that are under negotiation.Our efforts also continue toward a Free Trade Area of the Americas that would encompass all countries in the Hemisphere in an integrated market.

We are also using multilateral fora to advance a bold development agenda.At the 2004 Special Summit of the Americas, the hemisphere's leaders launched a broad array of initiatives to achieve objectives such as halving the cost of remittance transfers, tripling bank lending to small businesses, and significantly reducing the time and cost of starting a new business.We continue our bilateral efforts and cooperation with the IDB to implement these initiatives and achieve the ambitious goals the leaders have laid out.As the 2005 Summit of the Americas approaches--to be held in November 2005 in Argentina--we look forward to working with others to launch new initiatives to increase economic growth, for example, by promoting more productive investment in infrastructure.We also continue to work intensively with the World Bank and IDB to continue with their efforts to show measurable results in their activities by demonstrating that their budget and project lending is reaching quantifiable targets, while strong controls are in place to track where the money goes.

In our bilateral dialogues with individual countries we have advanced ideas for raising productivity growth and launched joint efforts in particular areas.Through the U.S.-Mexico Partnership for Prosperity launched in 2001, we have seen the cost of sending remittances between the U.S. and Mexico fall substantially.Through the U.S.-Brazil Group for Growth, we have targeted areas like small business lending and business regulation and yielded concrete results: our Brazilian counterparts told us that the Group's discussions have helped shape legislation submitted to the Brazilian Congress that reduces taxation and streamlines labor and pension regulations for Brazilian small business.Most recently, we launched the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America with Mexico and Canada, which will improve the legitimate flow of people and cargo at our shared borders and improve productivity through regulatory cooperation to generate growth.

I would like to see a further deepening of this type of dialogue with the other countries in the hemisphere.There is certainly a large agenda to discuss for a broader Latin American group focused on economic growth.

Finally, through the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) we are working with countries to help the poorest countries increase growth and productivity.This Bush Administration initiative is aimed at countries advancing the right policies--in the areas of ruling justly, investing in people, and promoting economic freedom.MCA assistance is designed to boost their efforts through well-targeted financial support.I am pleased that three countries in Latin America, Bolivia, Honduras, and Nicaragua, have the opportunity to benefit from MCA assistance this year by developing proposals for use of MCA funds.

**Conclusion**I am proud to have had to the opportunity to work on challenging economic and financial issues, as well as with my regional colleagues, over the past four years.Together, we have gone from crisis to growth.That growth will help reinforce the merits of good policy.I am confident that in its second term the Bush Administration is focused on the type of engagement with the region needed to build on this success, help the region and substantially raise its living standards and lay the groundwork for deeper cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America.

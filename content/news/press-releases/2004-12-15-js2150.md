Preliminary data from the benchmark survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2003 will be released on Friday, December 17 at 4:00 PM and posted on the U.S. Treasury web site ([www.treas.gov/tic](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic)). Final survey results, including additional detail and revisions to the data, will be reported by March 31, 2005.



The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The most recent preliminary survey was for year-end 2001, and some revisions from that survey are reported in this release. Future surveys are scheduled to be carried out annually and the next survey will be for year-end 2004.



A complementary benchmark survey measuring foreign holdings of U.S. securities is also carried out annually. Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held on June 30, 2004, are currently being processed. Preliminary results are expected to be reported by July 31, 2005.

**Washington, DC--** Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. issued the following statement today on the World Bank's Executive Board approval of Robert Zoellick to be World Bank President:

I welcome the board's action approving Bob Zoellick to lead the World Bank. Bob brings a wealth of experience, a passion for development and a proven track record of working with colleagues around the world to get results.

He has the trust, respect and support of governments in all regions of the world and I have no doubt his leadership will ensure continued support of World Bank members. He will be an aggressive advocate for overcoming poverty, investing in growth, and creating opportunity and hope.

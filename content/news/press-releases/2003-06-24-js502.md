FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-502

WASHINGTON, DC The U.S. Treasury Department has today designated 55 former senior Iraqi officials, the Department of Defenses 55 most wanted Iraqis or the so-called deck of cards,in an effort to secure and return their assets to the Iraqi people.  These names have been added to the Office of Foreign Assets Controls Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, freezing any accounts in U.S. jurisdiction and prohibiting transactions with U.S. persons.   According to the Department of Defense, 32 of the 55 designated today have been captured or have surrendered to coalition forces.

Additionally, the United States will submit these names to the United Nations for designation under UNSCR 1483 which requires all member states to freeze without delay funds or other financial assets or economic resources of Iraqi state bodies, corporations, or agencies located outside of Iraq, as well as funds or economic resources removed by Saddam Hussein, senior officials of the former Iraqi regime, and their immediate families.  Any assets belonging to these individuals must be returned to the Development Fund for Iraq and used for the good of the Iraqi people as required under the resolution.

Todays designation is yet another step in Treasurys effort to locate the assets plundered by Saddam Hussein and his cronies and return them to their rightful owners the Iraqi people.  As with any assets of the former Iraqi regime, any funds found will be used to help the people of Iraq as they rebuild their country after more than two decades of tyranny,Secretary Snow stated.

This action continues Treasurys effort to find, secure and return assets of the former Iraqi regime to the Iraqi people.  The Treasury Department has already returned over $660 million dollars in Iraqi assets previously frozen in the U.S. to Iraq where it has been used to pay civil servants and pensioners and to provide capital for Iraqi Ministries as they resume operation.  Additionally, the Treasury Department, working with allies, has located well over $1.2 billion dollars in previously unknown Iraqi assets and is working to facilitate the return of those assets to the Iraqi people through the Development Fund for Iraq.

A list of those designated is attached.

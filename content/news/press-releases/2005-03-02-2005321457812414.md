Secretary John Snow today held a press briefing to preview his March 3-4 trip to Fayetteville, AR and New Orleans, LA, and to announce the Administration's Social Security tour. During March and April, Administration officials will travel across the country as part of a coordinated 60-day tour of at least 60 stops to discuss the President's vision to strengthen and save Social Security with the American people. Officials will meet with groups of our youngest workers and our oldest retirees.

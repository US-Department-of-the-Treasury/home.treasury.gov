U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement announcing significant workforce investments in response to tax reform:
“To date, over one million American workers and counting are receiving special bonuses in response to President Trump signing the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.  Many other middle-income families are seeing their wages increased, and companies across the country are announcing additional hiring and workforce investments.
“This is only the beginning.  American workers will see bigger paychecks soon and keep more of their hard-earned money.  Our economy will continue to grow faster than it has in many years, leading to a brighter future for all Americans.  This is exactly why we worked so hard to deliver the most significant tax cuts and reform package in over three decades.”

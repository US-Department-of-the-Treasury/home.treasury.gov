**Washington, DC--**Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. made the following statement today in support of the candidacy of Dominique Strauss-Kahn for Managing Director at the International Monetary Fund:

I urge the Board to positively consider the candidacy of Dominique Strauss-Kahn to succeed Rodrigo de Rato. The U.S. is supporting Mr. Strauss-Kahn because we believe he will work to make the bold reforms necessary to lead a strong and relevant Fund into the future. Mr. Strauss-Kahn's experience and drive have prepared him well to vigorously pursue reform of the IMF, including implementation of the Fund's new decision on exchange rate policies and giving a greater voice to emerging market countries.

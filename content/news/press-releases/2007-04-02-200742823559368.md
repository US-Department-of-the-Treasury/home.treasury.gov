Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) are changing the way millions of American meet their health care needs.  HSAs put consumers and doctors back in charge of health care, making it more accessible and affordable.  America's Health Insurance Plans released a report today showing the number of individuals covered by Health Savings Accounts has increased by 43 percent over the last year, from about 3.2 million in January 2006 to about 4.5 million in January 2007.  In addition, according to the report, 27 percent of the new enrollees in the individual market were previously uninsured.

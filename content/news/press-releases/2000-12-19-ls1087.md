Throughout its eight years, the Clinton Administration has respected the independence of the Federal Reserve in making decisions about our nation's monetary policy. We have shared the Federal Reserve's goals of maintaining healthy economic growth while preserving low inflation.



Supported by sound economic policies, including fiscal discipline, open markets, and investment in people, the economy continues to grow, with strong investment and higher productivity, creating good jobs and improved living standards for all Americans.

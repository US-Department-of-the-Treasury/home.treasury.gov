The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated three Syrian proliferation entities pursuant to Executive Order 13382, an authority aimed at freezing the assets of proliferators of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their supporters. Syria is using official government organizations to develop nonconventional weapons and the missiles to deliver them, said Stuart Levey, Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI). We will continue to take action to prevent such state-sponsored WMD proliferators from using the international financial system.

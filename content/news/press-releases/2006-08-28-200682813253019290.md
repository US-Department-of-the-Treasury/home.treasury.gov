Today and tomorrow, President Bush will visit Biloxi and New Orleans to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The President will deliver remarks on the Gulf Coast's recovery; meet with state and local government officials, community leaders, volunteers, and residents; and tour neighborhoods devastated by Hurricane Katrina. This Tuesday marks the first anniversary of Katrina – one of the deadliest and most costly natural disasters in American history. … In Mississippi and Louisiana, we can see many encouraging signs of recovery and renewal, and many reminders that hard work still lies ahead. … We will stay until the job is done, and by working together, we will help our fellow citizens along the Gulf Coast write a new future of hope, justice, and opportunity for all. – President George W. Bush, 8/26/06

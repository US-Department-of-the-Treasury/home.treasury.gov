We welcome the program of economic reforms agreed to by the Prime Minister of Greece and the coalition parties, and the public statement of support from the major economies of Europe. This is a very strong and very difficult package of reforms, deserving of support of the international community and the IMF. The United States will encourage the IMF to support this agreement.

Secretary John W. Snow today joined Secretary of State Colin Powell in New York for a meeting of foreign ministers on the G-8/Broader Middle East and North Africa Initiative. The promotion of economic freedom, opportunity and growth throughout the world will be a key topic at my meetings next weekend during the annual meetings in Washington of the IMF and World Bank, said Secretary Snow. Economic freedom generates motivation, initiative, opportunity, growth and jobs. And having a job means the same thing in any country, in any language: that you can provide for yourself and your loved ones. It is a cornerstone of individual liberty.

HP-437

The final results from the annual survey of foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities at end-June 2006 are released today and posted on the U.S. Treasury web site at ([http://www.treas.gov/tic/fpis.html](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx)).

The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  Surveys are carried out annually, and the next survey will be for end-June 2007.

Complementary surveys measuring U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities are also carried out annually.  Data from the most recent survey, which reports on foreign securities held by U.S. residents at year-end 2006, are currently being processed.  Preliminary results are expected to be reported by September 30, 2007.

Overall Results

The survey measured foreign holdings as of June 30, 2006, of $7,778 billion; with $2,430 billion held in U.S. equities, $4,733 billion in U.S. long-term debt securities (of which $980 billion were holdings of asset-backed securities (ABS)), and $615 billion in U.S. short-term debt securities. The previous such survey, conducted as of June 30, 2005, measured foreign holdings of $6,864 billion; with $2,144 billion in U.S. equities, $4,118 billion in U.S. long-term debt securities (of which $717 billion were holdings of asset-backed securities (ABS)), and $602 billion in U.S. short-term debt securities.

Figures for 2006 reflect market prices at end-June 2006. Long-term securities have an original term-to-maturity of over one year. Asset-backed securities are backed by pools of assets, such as pools of residential home mortgages or credit card receivables, which give the security owners claims against the cash flows generated by the underlying assets.

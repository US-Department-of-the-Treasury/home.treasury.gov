FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

  

Secretary John Snow today addressed the Tax Executives Institute and highlighted the Administration's progress on tax cut permanency, tax code reform and Social Security reform. We need to work on keeping the path clear and solid for an economic future that is as good, or better, than the present. To do that, we've got to keep taxes low; we've got to make the President's tax cuts permanent so that families and small businesses can plan with confidence for their future. We've got to make fundamental, lasting improvements to our tax code. We've got to cut the deficit in half and enact an energy policy. And we've got to save Social Security.

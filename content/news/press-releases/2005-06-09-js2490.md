The introduction of comprehensive pension reform legislation byEducation and Workforce CommitteeChairman John Boehner,Ways and MeansCommiteeChairman Bill Thomas, and Employer-Employee Relations Subcommittee Chairman Subcommittee Chairman Sam Johnson is a significant step forward towards strengthening and securing pensions for American workers. I am pleased that their bill employs the essential structure of the Administration's proposal.

To ensure that worker's benefits are adequately funded, we continue to believe that pension plan assets and liabilities must be measured accurately, based on current market and credit conditions. Therefore, we will continue to work with the Congress to achieve pension reforms that ensure that the pension promises made are promises kept.

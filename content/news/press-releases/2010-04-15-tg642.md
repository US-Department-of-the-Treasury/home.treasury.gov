Foreign purchases of foreign securities = U.S. sales of foreign securities to foreigners. Thus negative entries indicate net U.S. purchases of foreign securities, or an outflow of capital from the United States; positive entries indicate net U.S. sales of foreign securities. /5 Minus estimated unrecorded principal repayments to foreigners on domestic corporate and agency asset-backed securities + estimated foreign acquisitions of U.S. equity through stock swaps - estimated U.S. acquisitions of foreign equity through stock swaps + increase in nonmarketable Treasury Bonds and Notes Issued to Official Institutions and Other Residents of Foreign Countries. /6 These are primarily data on monthly changes in banks' and broker/dealers' custody liabilities. Data on custody claims are collected quarterly and published in the Treasury Bulletin and the TIC website. /7 "Selected Other Liabilities" are primarily the foreign liabilities of U.S. customers that are managed by U.S. banks or broker/dealers. /8 TIC data cover most components of international financial flows, but do not include data on direct investment flows, which are collected and published by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In addition to the monthly data summarized here, the TIC collects quarterly data on some banking and nonbanking assets and liabilities.

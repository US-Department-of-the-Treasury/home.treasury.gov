FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-688



I welcome today's bipartisan approval by the House Banking Committee of important legislation to combat international money laundering. This is a significant step forward in our fight to protect the U.S. financial system against international money laundering and to confront those countries that serve as ready havens to hide and move dirty money around the world.



I congratulate Chairman Leach and Mr. LaFalce for their strong bipartisan leadership on this issue. I look forward to continuing to work with the House and the Senate toward enacting this important legislation to combat money laundering.

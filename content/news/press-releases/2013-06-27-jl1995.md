“With today’s bipartisan vote in the Senate, we are one step closer to fixing our broken immigration system.  This bill will usher in common-sense reform that will make our borders even more secure, provide a rigorous pathway to citizenship for the 11 million people who are here illegally, and modernize our laws so that entrepreneurs and engineers from around the world can contribute to business innovation in the United States.  This comprehensive legislation will also fuel growth and create jobs by bringing hard-working immigrants out of the shadows and giving them a chance to contribute to the vibrancy of our economy.  It will lead to greater productivity and higher wages, reduce the deficit, and help to improve the financial stability of Medicare and Social Security as new workers are put on payrolls.

 

The bill passed by the Senate today demonstrates that Democrats and Republicans can work together to solve our nation’s most pressing problems, and I urge the House of Representatives to move forward on this important issue as soon as possible.”

Secretary John Snow was in New Orleans, LA on Friday to speak to local business leaders about the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve the Social Security system. Social Security is sound for today's seniors and those nearing retirement, but to keep the promise of Social Security alive for our children and grandchildren, we need to fix the system now. He also commented on the February jobs report, saying, today's announcement that 262,000 new jobs have been created is good news for America and the growth of our economy.

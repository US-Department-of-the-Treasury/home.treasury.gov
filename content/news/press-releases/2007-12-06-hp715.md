U.S. Treasury Assistant Secretary David G. Nason will discuss Treasury efforts to strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. capital markets ([http://www.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Capital-Markets](https://home.treasury.gov/about/organizational-structure/offices/Pages/Capital-Markets)) before the City of London Corporation in London, England on Tues., Dec. 11.

When U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. first took office, he said ([https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp174](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp174)) promoting the competitiveness of U.S. capital markets is a vital issue to strengthening the U.S. economy. He hosted a major conference ([https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp304](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp304)) in March with international leaders on this issue.

As part of his plan ([https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp476](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp476)) for strengthening American capital markets he called for an examination of the structure of the U.S. financial regulatory system. One area of focus has been the difference between the U.S. financial regulatory structure and regulators around the world, including the benefits of the U.K. financial regulatory structure. Additionally, Treasury has been examining the benefits and consequences of the overlapping federal and state-based oversight on issues such as mortgage origination and insurance. The Department will release its recommendations for improvement early next year.

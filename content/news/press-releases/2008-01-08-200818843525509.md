Secretary Paulson is in New York today where he tours the NYSE trading floor and meets with officials there. Paulson gave a speech Monday at a forum hosted by the New York Society of Securities Analysts on the housing and capital markets. Our most immediate goal is to minimize the impact on the real economy. At the same time, we recognize the importance of addressing these policy issues, and we are. No single policy or action will undo the excesses of the last few years. President Bush and his Administration recognize the risks we face, and the primary importance of keeping the economy as strong as possible as we weather this housing correction, said Paulson.  **Remarks**

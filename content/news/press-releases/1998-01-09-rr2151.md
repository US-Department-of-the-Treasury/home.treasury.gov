Treasury Deputy Secretary Lawrence H. Summers will lead a U.S. delegation to Asia beginning tomorrow.



President Clinton last night asked Summers to visit the region to take stock of the economic situation, to hear the authorities' current plans, and to express the President's commitment to support effective stabilization efforts.



While the itinerary is tentative, the U.S. delegation will visit countries including the following: Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.



The delegation will include representatives from the Treasury Department, the State Department and the National Security Council.

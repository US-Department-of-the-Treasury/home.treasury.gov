Re:  Request for ReconsiderationDear Mr. Tolbert:We have received the materials submitted to the Air Transportation Stabilization Board (the Board) on January 24, 2002, by MEDjet International, Inc. (MEDjet).  In the materials, MEDjet requests reconsideration by the Board of its November 26, 2002 denial of MEDjets application (the Application) for a Federal loan guarantee under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act, Pub. L. No. 107-42, 115 Stat. 230 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 14 CFR Part 1300.



The Board and Board staff have reviewed and considered the information recently submitted.  The Board has determined that the information recently submitted does not alter in a material manner the rationale underlying the Boards November 26th decision.  Accordingly, the Boards November 26th denial of MEDjets Application remains in effect.

Last month, 274,000 jobs were created and unemployment stayed below the average of the last three decades. Altogether, about 3.5 million jobs have been created since May 2003. President Bush is committed to keeping the economy on the path of healthy growth by cutting the deficit in half, enacting an energy policy, and strengthening social security. The President's leadership on economic policy is clearly moving the economy in the right direction.

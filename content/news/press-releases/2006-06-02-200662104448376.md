In a statement Friday morning, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said that With unemployment at a remarkable 4.6 percent, this month's employment report shows continued strength in theU.S.labor market and an economy moving in the right direction. These gains are broad-based, with Hispanic unemployment at a new record low and African American unemployment reaching historic lows, lower than the average of the 1990s. Snow went on to say My recent announcement that I will leave Treasury marks this as my last official jobs day statement. I am pleased to note that virtually everywhere one looks there is good economic news. I take great satisfaction in the strong expansion the country is enjoying.- [Full Statement](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/js4302)

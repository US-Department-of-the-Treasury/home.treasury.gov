A Record of Discussions with respect to the new U.S.-Japan Income Tax Treaty was signed on May 19thinTokyobyU.S.and Japanese officials.The Record of Discussions provides clarification regarding the application of clause 3(c)(iv) of Article 11 of the Treaty, relating to the qualification of financial institutions for elimination of source-country withholding taxes on interest income.

Article 11 of the Treaty generally permits the source country to impose withholding taxes on interest at a maximum rate of 10 percent.However, paragraph 3(c) of Article 11 of the Treaty provides for the elimination of source-country withholding tax on interest received by banks (including investment banks), insurance companies, and registered securities dealers.Paragraph 3(c) of Article 11 also provides for the elimination of source-country withholding tax on interest received by other enterprises that meet asset and liability conditions set forth in clause (iv) that are characteristic of financial businesses.This provision is intended to ensure comparable treatment of different types of financial businesses.The particular language relating to asset and liability conditions for eligibility for the elimination of interest withholding tax is unique to the new U.S.-Japan Income Tax Treaty.The document signed on May 19thmemorializes the intended technical application of these conditions in the context of a financial business that operates through a multiple entity group.

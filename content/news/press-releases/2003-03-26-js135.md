JS-135



I commend the Senate for passing a budget resolution. A budget plan is essential to maintain fiscal accountability and allow expedited action on the President's Jobs and Growth plan. This is a significant accomplishment, considering that last year Congress failed to produce a budget plan. In my view, the tax relief amount contained in this budget does not go far enough to provide the economic impact the American economy needs now.  It's still early in the process, however, and this serves as a starting point to work with the House in conference to advance the President's plan. The President's plan is still the best way to create jobs, provide economic security to American workers and families, and grow the economy for our future.  I remain confident that significant tax relief in accordance with the President's plan will be passed.

JS-2176

The Air Transportation Stabilization Board (ATSB) has been in contact with Aloha Airlines over the past several months, working with the airline to avoid a Chapter 11 filing. In spite of these efforts and those of other stakeholders, Aloha has sought the protection of bankruptcy to finish its restructuring efforts. The Board will continue to work with Aloha through the bankruptcy process to ensure that the taxpayers' interests are protected.

The recommendations that the Panel presented today will begin the dialogue that will help shape the future of tax policy. Their advice is the starting point, and I look forward to reading their recommendations and considering them carefully before I make a recommendation to the President based on the excellent work carried out by this Panel. I congratulate the panel for their excellent work and a job well done.

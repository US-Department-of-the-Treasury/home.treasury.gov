Today's meeting of the Financial Literacy and Education Commission marks the group's second anniversary. The Commission was given the important task of improving financial literacy in the United States. Since its inception, the Commission has been working hard towards that goal, but we recognize that there is still a lot more to do. This Commission meeting is another step in the right direction by bringing together once again financial education leaders from the federal government and from the for-profit and non-profit sectors. Strong coordination across the federal government on financial education efforts and the growing enthusiasm of the private sector on this issue have helped the Commission in its work.

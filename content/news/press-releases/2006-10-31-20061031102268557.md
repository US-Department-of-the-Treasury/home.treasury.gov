The U.S. economy has proven both resilient and responsive adding jobs for 37 straight months - more than 6.6 million new jobs since August of  2003. I feel good about the U.S. economy, said Secretary Paulson in interviews from the Treasury Department last week. This economy is creating new jobs. It's a healthy economy. Tax cuts have helped our economy grow faster than any other major developed nation. President Bush's tax cuts have put more money in the hands of American workers, families, and businesses.

**WASHINGTON** – Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) joined the Government of Mexico in targeting the Hysa Organized Crime Group and numerous Mexico-based gambling establishments involved in cartel-related money laundering and a slew of other criminal activities across Mexico and Europe. This coordinated action is the result of recent U.S.-Mexico commitments—secured during Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley’s [trip](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0250)—to work together more closely to combat narcotrafficking and related financial crime by Mexico-based drug cartels and other groups.

“The United States and Mexico are working together to combat money laundering in Mexico’s gambling sector. Our message to those supporting the cartels is clear: You will be held accountable,” said ** Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley**.  “We thank the Government of Mexico for its strong partnership in this effort.”

OFAC today sanctioned 27 individuals and entities, and FinCEN proposed a special measure to sever 10 Mexico-based gambling establishments’ access to the U.S. financial system due to money laundering concerns.

## OFAC SANCTIONS TARGETING THE HYSA ORGANIZED CRIME GROUP

The ** Hysa Organized Crime Group** (HOCG), which includes family members ** Luftar Hysa** (** Luftar**),** Arben Hysa** (** Arben**),** Ramiz Hysa** (** Ramiz**),** Fatos Hysa** (** Fatos**), and ** Fabjon Hysa** (** Fabjon**), has used its influence through its investments in, or control over, various Mexico-based businesses—including gambling establishments and restaurants—to launder the proceeds of narcotics trafficking.  The HOCG is believed to operate with the consent of the Sinaloa Cartel, which maintains criminal control over much of the territory where the group conducts its activities.

Luftar, based between Mexico and Canada, is often seen in public media as a leading member of the Hysa family, providing public interviews on his family’s businesses in Mexico and Europe.  Luftar, Fatos, Arben, and Fabjon have worked closely with a U.S. person to launder money, including the movement of bulk cash from Mexico to the United States, where the U.S. person’s company was used to launder the funds.  Luftar and Arben have utilized a Europe-based entity to enrich themselves from laundering illicit funds belonging to suspected narcotraffickers. Luftar also owns or directs several companies used by the HOCG.

Arben owns or directs several companies used by the HOCG in Mexico.  Arben has also been involved in the smuggling of bulk cash to the United States for the purposes of money laundering, as well as the use of gambling establishments and luxury restaurants in Mexico to launder drug money.

Ramiz has been involved in the use of gambling establishments and luxury restaurants in Mexico as fronts for laundering the proceeds of the sale of narcotics.

Fatos, alongside Luftar, Arben, and Fabjon, was involved in smuggling bulk cash into the United States for the purpose of laundering money.  Fatos and Fabjon were also involved in the use of a Europe-based entity to enrich themselves from laundering illicit funds belonging to suspected narcotraffickers.

With today’s action, OFAC is also targeting several individuals and entities within HOCG’s network. Mexico-based ** Entretenimiento Palmero, S.A. de C.V.**, owned by Arben, is central to the HOCG’s operations. Mexican national ** Gilberto Lopez Lopez** acts as its commissioner. Albanian national but Mexico-based ** Eselda Baku** (formerly Eselda Hysa), Ramiz’s daughter, sits on its Board of Directors. Additional companies targeted with this action include:

- ** Bliri S.A. de C.V.** (Mexico)
- ** Cucina Del Porto S.A. de C.V.** (Mexico)
- ** Diversiones Los Mochis S.A. de C.V.** (Mexico)

## SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS

As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons is blocked and must be reported to OFAC.  In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked.  Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of blocked persons.

Violations of U.S. sanctions may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties on U.S. and foreign persons.  OFAC may impose civil penalties for sanctions violations on a strict liability basis. [OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-501/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%20501) provide more information regarding OFAC’s enforcement of U.S. economic sanctions. In addition, financial institutions and other persons may risk exposure to sanctions for engaging in certain transactions or activities involving designated or otherwise blocked persons.  The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated or blocked person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.

Furthermore, engaging in certain transactions involving the persons designated today may risk the imposition of secondary sanctions on participating foreign financial institutions.  OFAC can prohibit or impose strict conditions on opening or maintaining, in the United States, a correspondent account or a payable-through account of a foreign financial institution that knowingly conducts or facilitates any significant transaction on behalf of a person who is designated pursuant to the relevant authority.

The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law.  The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior.  For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, or to submit a request, please refer to OFAC’s guidance on [Filing a Petition for Removal from an OFAC List](https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/filing-a-petition-for-removal-from-an-ofac-list).

## FINCEN PROPOSES SPECIAL MEASURE TO CUT OFF 10 GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS FROM THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM

Concurrently, and in coordination with OFAC and the Government of Mexico, FinCEN issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), pursuant to section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, identifying transactions involving 10 Mexico-based gambling establishments as a class of transactions of primary money laundering concern.  The HOCG operates these gambling establishments, which for years have been used to facilitate money laundering that benefits the Sinaloa Cartel.  The gambling establishments are:

- ** Emine Casino**, located in San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, Mexico
- ** Casino Mirage**, located in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico
- ** Midas Casino**, located Agua Prieta, Sonora, Mexico
- ** Midas Casino**, located in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico
- ** Midas Casino**, located in Guamuchil, Sinaloa, Mexico
- ** Midas Casino**, located in Mazatlan, Sinaloa, Mexico
- ** Midas Casino**, located in Rosarito, Baja California, Mexico
- ** Palermo Casino**, located in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico
- ** Skampa Casino**, located in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico
- ** Skampa Casino**, located in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico

To address the risks presented by these gambling establishments, FinCEN proposes in the NPRM the imposition of a special measure that would:  (1) prohibit covered financial institutions from opening or maintaining a correspondent account for any foreign banking institution if such account is used to process transactions involving any of the gambling establishments; and (2) require covered financial institutions to apply special due diligence to their correspondent accounts that is reasonably designed to guard against the use of such accounts to process transactions involving any of the gambling establishments.

[FinCEN’s NPRM, as submitted to the *Federal Register*, is available here](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2025-19927/special-measure-regarding-transactions-involving-ten-mexican-gambling-establishments-as-a-class-of).

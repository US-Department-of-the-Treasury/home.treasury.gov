Today's employment report confirms that our economic momentum continues. In the tenth consecutive month of job growth, 112,000 more Americans were added to the payrolls. Job growth through the first half of this year averaged more than 200,000 a month. These are jobs in good industries and there can be no doubt that the President's well-timed tax relief spurred this growth.



We have fought our way out of recession and are now seeing positive news on many fronts. Consumer confidence is strong, home sales are at record highs, and economic growth over the past three quarters is the strongest it's been in 20 years. America's best economic days are ahead of us and under the leadership of President Bush, we will continue on this path of non-inflationary economic growth and job creation.

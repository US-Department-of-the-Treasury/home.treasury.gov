Treasury Secretary John Snow joined President Bush and other members of the economic team at the Western White Housethis week to discuss the economy and ongoing initiatives to create jobs and economic growth. President Bush, during a Q and A session with reporters after the meeting, said, We believe strongly that the tax relief plan that was approved by Congress in '01, and most recently in '03, is going to have a very positive effect on economic growth and vitality. We believe it is more likely in the upcoming year that people are going to be able to find a job.

I welcome the Senate vote on the IRS reform bill. I believe that it will lead to a final bill with the organizational and personnel provisions that will give Commissioner Rossotti the tools he needs to create the IRS the American people deserve. I commend the bipartisan effort in the Senate to pass this bill.

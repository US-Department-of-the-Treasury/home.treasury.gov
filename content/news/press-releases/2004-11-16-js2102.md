The U. S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has adopted a policy to issue specific licenses, on a case by case basis, authorizing U.S. suppliers to engage in certain transactions with the following Colombian Government-controlled entities, which have been designated by OFAC as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNTs) pursuant to 31 CFR Part 536:

 
- Cooperativa Multiactiva de Empleados de Distribuidores de Drogas Copservir Ltda. (COPSERVIR), NIT # 830011670-3, which manages the Drogas La Rebaja establishments in Colombia;
- Cooperativa Multiactiva de Comercializacion y Servicios Farmacoop (FARMACOOP) NIT # 830010878-3;
- Cooperativa de Cosmeticos y Populares Cosmepop (COSMEPOP) NIT # 800251322-5.
 

The Government of Colombia took control of these companies in September 2004.By establishing a licensing policy, OFAC is ensuring that these entities continue to operate and do so in a legitimate manner under the control of the Colombian government, thereby preserving the jobs of several thousand Colombians who were unknowingly manipulated byCalidrug cartel leaders Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez-Orejuela. OFAC continues to work closely with Colombian officials to monitor the situation.

U.S. suppliers seeking a license to sell products to COPSERVIR, FARMACOOPor COSMEPOP should submit a written license application in accordance with 31 CFR 501.801(b) to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Licensing Division, U.S. Department of the Treasury, 1500 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Annex, Washington, DC 20220.

In addition to the information required by 31 CFR 501.801(b)(3), the application must include a detailed description of the proposed transactions, the source and method of payment and a copy of a signed purchase request from any of the aforementioned cooperatives.Questions regarding this policy should be directed to OFAC's Licensing Division at (202) 622-2480.

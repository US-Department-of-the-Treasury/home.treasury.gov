**Introduction**Today's meeting marks the beginning of the Panel's important work to explore ways to reform the Federal tax code. I believe that it is a good sign that we are holding our first meeting to discuss reform in the building that bears the name of Ronald Reagan, who initiated the last bipartisan effort to reform the tax code twenty years ago. As we will hear today, a lot has changed since then. This panel will take a fresh look at the existing tax code and will formulate options for making the tax system simple, fair, and
productive. I am privileged to serve as the Panel's chairman and would like to thank Vice-Chairman Breaux and the rest of the Panel for agreeing to help tackle this challenging task.

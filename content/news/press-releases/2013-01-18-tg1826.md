**WASHINGTON –**Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced that it took the next step in its plan to sell its approximately 300.1 million remaining shares of General Motors (GM) common stock with the initiation of a pre-arranged written trading plan.

  

Under the plan, Treasury will proceed with its December 2012 announcement that it intends to sell its shares into the market in an orderly fashion and fully exit its remaining GM investment within the next 12-15 months, subject to market conditions. That previous announcement was made in connection with GM’s repurchase of 200 million shares of GM common stock from Treasury, which was also completed in December 2012.

  

Treasury’s sale of its GM common stock is part of its continuing efforts to wind down the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). To date, Treasury has already recovered nearly 93 percent ($387 billion) of the funds disbursed through TARP ($418 billion).

  

There will be opportunities for smaller broker dealers, including women and minority-owned broker dealers, to participate in the sale of Treasury's remaining GM common shares pursuant to the plan.

  

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any shares of GM common stock.

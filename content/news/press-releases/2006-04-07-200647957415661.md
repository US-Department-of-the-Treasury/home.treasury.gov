In a statement Friday morning on the March employment report, Treasury Secretary John Snow said: This employment report, showing 211,000 new jobs in March, is clear-cut evidence that the President's economic policies are working. Since the President's Jobs and Growth Act took effect, we have seen 5.2 million new jobs. This really speaks to the strength of the U.S. economy, with more Americans working than at any time in our history. Moreover, they have more money in their pockets. The American economy is clearly moving in the right direction, and I am confident that we will remain on a good path.

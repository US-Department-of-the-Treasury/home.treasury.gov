*Provides a New Opportunity for Syria and Accountability for Bashar al Assad and His Supporters*

**WASHINGTON**— Today, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is taking action to implement President Trump’s historic Executive Order (E.O.) of June 30, 2025, “Providing for the Revocation of Syria Sanctions,” removing U.S. sanctions on Syria in support of the Syrian people and their new government as they rebuild their country and have the opportunity to become a stable and prosperous nation at peace with itself and its neighbors.  Today’s E.O. revokes the Executive orders that previously placed comprehensive sanctions on Syria.  The E.O. also ensures continued accountability for the Bashar al-Assad regime, expanding the national emergency declared in E.O. 13894 to allow for the continuation of sanctions against Bashar al-Assad, his associates, and other destabilizing regional actors.

Concurrent with the E.O.’s issuance, OFAC removed 518 individuals and entities from the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) sanctioned under the Syria sanctions program, lifting sanctions on individuals and entities critical to Syria’s development, the operation of its government, and the rebuilding of the country’s social fabric.  OFAC also designated 139 individuals and entities affiliated with the previous regime under E.O. 13894, as further amended, as well as other Iran and Counter Terrorism authorities, ensuring continued accountability for the former al-Assad regime and its abuses.

The circumstances that gave rise to OFAC’s Syria sanctions program, related to the brutal former regime of Bashar al-Assad, have been transformed by developments over the past six months, including the positive actions taken by the new Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa.  Today’s E.O. and actions by the [Department of State](https://www.state.gov/releases/ending-the-syria-sanctions-program-for-the-benefit-of-the-syrian-people/), the Department of the Treasury, and Department of Commerce advance the U.S. government effort to remove the full architecture of sanctions imposed on Syria.

“In line with President Trump’s promise to deliver sanctions relief for Syria, today’s actions will help provide the country the opportunity to reestablish ties to global commerce and build international confidence,” said **Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent**.  “As we continue to monitor progress on the ground, we remain focused on preventing Assad, his cronies, terrorists, and other illicit actors from attempting to destabilize Syria and the region.”

Sanctions will remain on Bashar al-Assad and his associates, human rights abusers, captagon traffickers, persons linked to Syria’s past proliferation activities, ISIS and Al-Qa’ida affiliates, and Iran and its proxies.  For additional information, please see OFAC’s [Promoting Accountability for Assad and Regional Stabilization Sanctions Page.](https://ofac.treasury.gov/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/paarss)

For more information on OFAC’s implementation of the Executive order issued today, please see [Frequently Asked Questions 1220-1223](https://ofac.treasury.gov/faqs/added/2025-06-30).

### TERMINATION OF THE SYRIA SANCTIONS PROGRAM

To support the people of Syria and their new government as they rebuild their country after many years of destruction caused by the former regime of Bashar al-Assad, OFAC is implementing the President’s termination of the Syria sanctions program.  As a result, OFAC is removing individuals and entities blocked solely under the Syria sanctions program from the SDN List. Accordingly, all property and interests in property of such individuals and entities will be unblocked.  In addition, OFAC will remove the Syrian Sanctions Regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations.

Pending or future OFAC investigations or enforcement actions related to apparent violations of the Syrian Sanctions Regulations that occurred prior to July 1, 2025, may still be carried out.

### SANCTIONS IMPLICATIONS

As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property of the designated or blocked persons described above that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.  In addition, any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more blocked persons are also blocked.  Unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC, or exempt, OFAC’s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within (or transiting) the United States that involve any property or interests in property of blocked persons.

Violations of U.S. sanctions may result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties on U.S. and foreign persons.  OFAC may impose civil penalties for sanctions violations on a strict liability basis. [OFAC’s Economic Sanctions Enforcement Guidelines](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-31/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-501/appendix-Appendix%20A%20to%20Part%20501) provide more information regarding OFAC’s enforcement of U.S. economic sanctions.  In addition, financial institutions and other persons may risk exposure to sanctions for engaging in certain transactions or activities with designated or otherwise blocked persons.  The prohibitions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any designated or blocked person, or the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.

The power and integrity of OFAC sanctions derive not only from OFAC’s ability to designate and add persons to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List), but also from its willingness to remove persons from the SDN List consistent with the law.  The ultimate goal of sanctions is not to punish, but to bring about a positive change in behavior.  For information concerning the process for seeking removal from an OFAC list, including the SDN List, or to submit a request, please refer to OFAC’s guidance on [Filing a Petition for Removal from an OFAC List](https://ofac.treasury.gov/specially-designated-nationals-list-sdn-list/filing-a-petition-for-removal-from-an-ofac-list).

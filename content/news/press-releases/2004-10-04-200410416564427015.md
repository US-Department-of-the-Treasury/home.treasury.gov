Today, President Bush signed the 'Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004' into law. Because of the President's leadership, this historic tax relief will keep our economic recovery on track and prevent a tax increase on 94 million Americans. Some of the biggest winners today are the lower and middle income families who benefit from the lowest 10% bracket, the increased child credit, marriage penalty relief and alternative tax relief (AMT).

Today’s strategy reinforces the importance of the President’s proposed reorganization of the security agencies tasked with protecting America’s borders. By placing Customs, the Coast Guard, INS and TSA under the same department we will be one step closer toward creating the smart border of the future. Today’s rollout makes it clear to the terrorists and to the world that we have not forgotten September 11th. We are more committed than ever to protecting our borders and securing our citizens with every resource we have available to us.

**Family A: Access to Refinancing**



**In 2006:** Family A took a 30-year fixed rate mortgage of $207,000 on a house worth $260,000 at the time. (The family put just over 20% down.) They received a Fannie Mae conforming loan with an interest rate of 6.50%.



- **Today:** Family A has about $200,000 remaining on their mortgage but their home value has fallen 15 percent to $221,000.

- Their loan-to-value ratio is now 90%, **making them ineligible for a Fannie Mae refinancing.**
- **Under the Refinancing Plan:**Family A can refinance to a rate of 5.16%. **This would reduce their annual payments by nearly $2,350.**

**Family C: Eligible for Homeowner Stability Initiative**



**In 2006**: Family C took out a 30-year subprime mortgage of $220,000, on a house worth $230,000 at the time (they put less than 5% down). Their mortgage broker – Mom & Pop Mortgage – sold their loan to Investment Bank. The interest rate on their mortgage is 7.5%.



- **Today**: Family C has $214,016 remaining on their mortgage but their home value has fallen -18% to $189,000. Also, in November, one parent in Family C was moved from full-time to part-time work, causing a significant negative shock to their income.
- **Under the Homeowner Stability Initiative:**Family C can get a government sponsored modification that – for five years – will reduce their mortgage payment by $406 a month. After those five years, Family C's mortgage payment will adjust upward at a moderate, phased-in level.

**Homeowner Stability Initiative: How the Program Works for the Lender, Government and Borrower**



- First, Investment Bank (working through a mortgage servicer) **reduces the interest rate so that the Family C's monthly debt-to-income ratio drops** from 42% to 38%. This means that Investment Bank must reduce the interest rate from 7.50% to 6.38%, bringing down Family C's monthly payment from $1,538 to $1,387.
- Second, the government and Investment Bank **share the cost of further reducing the interest rate** so that the Family C's monthly debt-to-income level is lowered to 31%. Any dollar the bank spends is matched by the government. At this stage, Family C's interest rate is reduced from 6.41% to 4.43%. In total, Family C's monthly payment has fallen from $ 1,538 to $1,132.
- If Family C remains current on their payments, they will receive **incentive payments** up to $1,000 a year, or $5,000 over five years, that would go towards reducing the principal they owe. Additionally, the mortgage servicer can earn an up-front incentive fee of $1,000, plus up to $1,000 per year in Pay for Success fees for three years, so long as Family C remains current.

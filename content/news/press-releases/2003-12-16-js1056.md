I am encouraged to see today’s strong report on new residential construction.  The continuing good performance of this sector is adding to the underlying fundamental strength of the economy.  2003 should be the best year for home building since 1978.

I am also encouraged by today’s Consumer Price Index report, which underscores the potential for a long and sustainable recovery.  We are continuing to see increased growth and job creation as the President’s economic initiatives begin to take effect, but there is more yet to be done.  We will continue our efforts until every American looking for work can find a job.

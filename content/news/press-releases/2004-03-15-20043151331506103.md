President Bush today is in Pennsylvania to talk about the importance of homeownership, which is at an historic high. Secretary Snow has highlighted the Administration's efforts to maintain the safety and soundness of the housing finance sector, saying we must promote the health and strength of the housing finance markets, together with the health and strength of the U.S. financial system. In the U.S. economy today, the two are closely related.

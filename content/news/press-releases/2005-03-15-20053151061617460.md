Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy Mark Warshawsky today addressed the America's Community Bankers' annual conference in Washington, DC. In his remarks, he highlighted the importance of strengthening and preserving the Social Security system. The generations of current and near-retirees have an awfully important opportunity: to be the ones to usher in a new generation of shareholders in the American Dream. All of our children and grandchildren should have an opportunity that not all of us currently have – an opportunity to own their retirement, a nest egg they could pass on to their heirs.

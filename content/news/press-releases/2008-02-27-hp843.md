Washington - The Treasury Department helped launch a new curriculum to improve the personal financial literacy of middle school students today with support from the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy. The free program, titled Money Math: Lessons for Life, helps teachers integrate personal finance topics into mathematics classes.



Money Math is a four-lesson, 86-page curriculum that uses real-life examples to teach personal finance through middle school mathematics concepts.  The President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy recently recommended that Treasury actively promote the project through its outreach efforts and through the Financial Literacy and Education Commission's MyMoney.gov website.



The University of Missouri/St. Louis, JumpStart Coalition for Personal Finance, and Citi worked in consultation with Treasury on the new version of Money Math.  Treasury's Bureau of Public Debt will distribute the curriculum to teachers.

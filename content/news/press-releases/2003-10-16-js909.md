**Indian Crime Lord has Assisted Al Qaida and Supported Other Terrorists in  India** WASHINGTON The U.S. Treasury Department today announced that it is designating Dawood Ibrahim as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224 and will be requesting that the United Nations list him as well.Todays designation freezes any assets belonging to Ibrahim within the U.S. and prohibits transactions with U.S. nationals.The UN listing will require that all UN Member States take similar actions.

         

This designation signals our commitment to identifying and attacking the financial ties between the criminal underworld and terrorism,stated Juan Zarate, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes.We are calling on the international community to stop the flow of dirty money that kills.For the Ibrahim syndicate, the business of terrorism forms part of their larger criminal enterprise, which must be dismantled.

         

Dawood Ibrahim, an Indian crime lord, has found common cause with Al Qaida, sharing his smuggling routes with the terror syndicate and funding attacks by Islamic extremists aimed at destabilizing the Indian government.He is wanted in India for the 1993 Bombay Exchange bombings and is known to have financed the activities of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (Army of the Righteous), a group designated by the United States in October 2001 and banned by the Pakistani Government -- who also froze their assets -- in January 2002.

         

With todays designation, the U.S. and our international partners have designated 322 individuals and organizations as terrorists and terrorist supporters and have frozen over $136.8 million in terrorist assets.

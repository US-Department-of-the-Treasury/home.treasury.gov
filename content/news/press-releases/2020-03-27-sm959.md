**WASHINGTON**—U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today following passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act):



“I am pleased that Congress has passed the CARES Act, the largest economic relief package in history for hardworking Americans and businesses that, through no fault of their own, have been adversely impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.



“I want to thank President Trump for his bold leadership and Vice President Pence for his outstanding work leading the White House Coronavirus Task Force. I also want to thank Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, and Leader McCarthy for working on a bipartisan basis to achieve results for the American people.



“President Trump is fully committed to ensuring that American workers and businesses have the resources they need. This legislation provides much-needed relief to help our fellow Americans overcome this difficult but temporary challenge.”

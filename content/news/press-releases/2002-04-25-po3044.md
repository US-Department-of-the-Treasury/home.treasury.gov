I am pleased to see that the president of Argentina and all the provincial governors have stated their intent to take serious actions. This is a welcome expression of a spirit of national cooperation. We want to see them succeed in implementing the actions in the time frames indicated. We encourage the government to move forward in close contact with the International Monetary Fund.

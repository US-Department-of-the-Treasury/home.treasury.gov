Secretary John W. Snow today testified before the House Financial Services Committee on reform proposals for housing government-sponsored enterprises. Our primary goals in developing our GSE reform proposal are to promote the strength and resilience of our housing finance markets, lessen the potential for systemic risk, and continue our progress in meeting the mortgage credit needs of all our Nation's homebuyers. To accomplish those purposes, the fundamental elements of reform that the Administration has proposed are essential.

The Treasury Department today announced its mentor protege program Success Partnerships. Success Partnerships, designed to establish business relationships between small companies and large prime contractors, was created as part of BusinessLINC (Learning, Information, Network and Collaboration), a partnership between the federal government and business community to encourage large businesses to work with small business entrepreneurs in economically distressed areas.

Fifteen large and small businesses will participate in Success Partnerships as mentor and protege teams, and work with the Treasury bureaus including the ATF, Secret Service, Internal Revenue Service, and Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

"Treasury believes in the value of facilitating these kinds of relationships because both companies can become more competitive," said Theodore Carter, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management. "Through Success Partnerships, mentors and proteges will be able to contribute to the growth of the economy and the pace of innovation."

Success Partnerships will help increase the participation of small, minority and women-owned businesses in the economy. Totaling more than $10 million in contract opportunities, primarily in the area of information technology, the mentors will provide the protégés with management support, access to capital and credit, and enhanced marketing and business planning efforts.

JS-653

The Treasury Departments Office of Financial Education (OFE) today announced the availability of a new online Federal Financial Education Resources directory that will make financial education information more accessible to government entities, community-based organizations, and the general public.

The directory, available at[www.treas.gov/financialeducation](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/financial-education), provides access to the many resources available within the federal government to assist in the implementation of financial education initiatives. More than twenty-five separate resources are listed, and programs are catalogued by subject area, program name and sponsoring organization.

Throughout the federal government, agencies are sponsoring and developing financial education initiatives directed to a broad and diverse constituency, and for the first time, this wealth of resources is available in a single location,said Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Wayne A. Abernathy.  This directory is a great first step in providing access to financial education for all Americans.

The Office of Financial Education, established in 2002, seeks to ensure that all Americans have access to financial education programs and that they obtain the practical knowledge and skill sets that will enable them to make informed financial choices throughout various life stages.

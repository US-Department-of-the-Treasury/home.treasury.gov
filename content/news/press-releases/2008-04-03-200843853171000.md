Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. delivered remarks on energy cooperation and the environment in Beijing yesterday. The United States and China, individually and together, continue to find ways to maintain economic growth while also developing sustainable and secure energy supplies, and protecting and conserving the environment, said Paulson. The Secretary traveled to China this week to meet with the newly appointed leadership and discuss a broad range of economic issues. Presidents Bush and Hu established the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) in 2006 to provide a focused and effective framework for addressing economic issues of mutual concern. The SED focuses on a range of issues including financial sector reform and increased currency flexibility, the integrity of trade and product safety, and investment.

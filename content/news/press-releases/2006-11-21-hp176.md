Bob Werner exemplifies civil service at its best.  Starting as a federal prosecutor for the Department of Justice and rising in the ranks to now serve as Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the Treasury, Bob has dedicated much of his life to serving the American people by striving to protect the financial system from abuse.



Under Bob's leadership, FinCEN has paved new inroads in partnering with the financial community to safeguard against financial crime while promoting the free flow of capital.  Bob's expert hand has helped FinCEN continue on a successful course.



Bob's tenure with the Department took him from the Office of the General Counsel to Chief of Staff at FinCEN and Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, before he returned to FinCEN to take the helm as Director.  He excelled in each of those roles.  Bob's good nature, sharp mind, and in-depth understanding of the workings of the Treasury will be missed throughout the Department.

    “We welcome the news that Congress has acted to meet its responsibility to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by extending the nation’s debt limit.  This week’s action combined with the two-year budget agreement and the omnibus spending bill - all of which passed Congress with bipartisan majorities - will provide certainty and stability to businesses and financial markets and should add momentum to the economic growth forecasted in 2014.  Despite the steady progress we have made, we know there is more we can do to expand the middle class and create opportunities for all Americans.  We are eager to continue to partner with Congress on these efforts on behalf of the American people.”   #*##*

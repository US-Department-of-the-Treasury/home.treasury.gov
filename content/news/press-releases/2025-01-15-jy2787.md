WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) released the first[Annual Table](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-25-14.pdf)that provides greenhouse gas emissions rates for certain types or categories of facilities that are eligible for the Clean Electricity Production and Investment Tax Credits – also known as the technology-neutral credits – in tax code sections 45Y and 48E.

The Clean Electricity Credits encourage innovation by allowing new technologies that develop over time to become eligible for the tax credits. The Annual Table released today provides important confirmation that certain clean electricity facilities qualify categorically for the credits – including geothermal, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, wind, solar, hydropower, marine and hydrokinetic, and certain waste energy recovery property facilities – consistent with the[final rules](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2025-00196/clean-electricity-production-credit-and-clean-electricity-investment-credit)released earlier this month.

REV. PROC. 2025-14 TABLE 1

**Treasury proceeds with implementation of the  Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 WASHINGTON**– The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced today that it has begun implementing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (Reauthorization Act), which was signed into law on January 12, 2015.  As part of this implementation, Treasury’s Federal Insurance Office (FIO) released Interim Guidance addressing the immediate application of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (Program) regulations in light of the Reauthorization Act.

This Interim Guidance may be relied upon by members of the public until superseded by the Program regulations, as amended, or by subsequent guidance.  A copy of the Interim Guidance, which will be published in the Federal Register, is available on the Program’s website[HERE.](http://treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Documents/Interim-Guidance-%28Website%29-02-04-15.pdf)

In addition, FIO released a notice seeking public comment regarding potential improvements to the process for certifying an event as an “act of terrorism.”  These comments will be used by FIO in the completion of a study and report required by the Reauthorization Act, as well as in the formation of final rules related to the certification process.  The notice will be published in the Federal Register, and a copy of it is available[HERE​.   ​](http://treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Documents/Certification-Study-Notice.pdf)

The United States welcomes the agreement reached between the IMF and Ukraine today.  Alongside financial assistance from the United States and other partners, this program will provide support that is essential to helping Ukraine in its continued efforts to restore economic stability, pursue urgently needed economic reforms, strengthen governance and the rule of law, and limit the hardships facing the Ukrainian people.  Fully implemented, this ambitious IMF program will play an important role in helping to unleash Ukraine’s considerable untapped economic potential, and it once again highlights the central role of the IMF as the world’s first responder to global economic challenges and in promoting economic growth. The United States, along with its international partners, remains committed to ensuring that Ukraine has the financial and technical assistance it needs as it undertakes its far-reaching reform program.

Secretary Lew discussed the need for exchange rate authorities to abide by their G-7 and G-20 commitments and remain in close contact.
Secretary Lew also spoke about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and emphasized that no new sanctions relief would be provided until the International Atomic Energy Agency has verified that Iran has implemented key nuclear-related measures and that sanctions related to terrorism and regional destabilization would remain in place after that.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury announced today that it priced a secondary public offering of the remaining 2,770,117 shares of common stock of Central Pacific Financial Corp. (the “Company”) it holds at $13.15 per share. The aggregate net proceeds to Treasury from the offering are expected to be $36.0 million.
 
After this offering, Treasury will no longer hold any shares of the Company’s common stock. In June 2011, Treasury sold 2,850,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at $12.75 per share for net proceeds of $35.9 million. Including today’s transaction, the expected total aggregate net proceeds from Treasury’s sale of its common stock position in the Company is $71.9 million.
 
Treasury will continue to hold warrants to purchase 79,288 shares of the Company’s common stock – the disposition of which will provide additional proceeds to taxpayers.  Treasury’s initial preferred stock investment in the Company, made as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program’s (TARP) Capital Purchase Program (CPP), was exchanged for common stock on February 18, 2011 as part of a larger recapitalization of the Company.  Today’s sale is part of Treasury's ongoing efforts to exit its remaining TARP investments and recover taxpayer dollars.
 
TARP’s bank programs have already earned a significant profit for taxpayers. Including the expected proceeds from today’s transaction, Treasury has recovered $260 billion from TARP’s bank programs through repayments, dividends, interest, and other income – compared to the $245 billion initially invested.  Each additional dollar recovered from TARP’s bank programs is an additional dollar of profit for taxpayers.
 
The closing is expected to occur on or about April 4, 2012, subject to customary closing conditions.  Sandler O’Neill & Partners, L.P. was the sole underwriter for the offering. A registration statement relating to the shares in this offering and shares held by certain other selling shareholders was previously filed by the Company and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  These filings are available on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov/).

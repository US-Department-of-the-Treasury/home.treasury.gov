FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
LS-1046
The United Stated Government, having participated in helping to mediate the resolution of the Swiss bank cases, welcomes Judge Korman's approval of the allocation plan. The court has found that the Special Master has fairly balanced the various interests involved. We favor the earliest possible distribution of the fund to needy survivors.
This important step brings us closer to achieving a measure of justice for Holocaust victims and their heirs.
I am pleased that the court has found that the proposed allocation and distribution plan is fair and reasonable. I hope that cooperation among all who have participated in this settlement will soon bring payments to the many categories of claimants who so richly deserve to receive them.
I also want to note the positive roles the participating Swiss banks and other entities have played in setting an example for the international community as we bring to a just and dignified conclusion the unfinished business of a passing and often tragic century. The settlement their efforts underpin has helped shape a better, more just Europe and world for the coming century.

“Today’s potent and carefully designed actions, together with today’s designations of arms-related entities, separatists, and Russian government officials, were taken to increase pressure on the Russian government to end its de-stabilizing actions in Ukraine while minimizing costs to the global economy.  We continue to coordinate with our international partners and remain in steadfast agreement that the people of Ukraine must be allowed to come together to make their own decisions about the future of their country, as Ukraine’s long-term stability is important for Europe, for Russia, and for the United States.  Even as we continue to work with our partners to de-escalate the situation, we remain fully prepared to continue increasing the financial and economic pressure on Russia if it does not cease its provocative behavior.”

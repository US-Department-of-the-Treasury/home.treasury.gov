This morning, the Prime Minister of Japan outlined his Government's plans to restore the health of the Japanese financial system and to strengthen domestic demand. We look forward to implementation of a comprehensive action program that will create the conditions that are essential for a healthy and prosperous economy. Japan has the financial resources and the capacity to deal with the challenges it faces. Asia and the international community as a whole have a large stake in Japan's success. In the context of Japan's plans to strengthen its economy, the U.S. monetary authorities operated in the exchange market this morning in cooperation with the monetary authorities of Japan. We are prepared to continue to cooperate in exchange markets, as appropriate.

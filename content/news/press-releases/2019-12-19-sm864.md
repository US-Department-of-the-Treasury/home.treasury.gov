**Washington **–The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS today issued final regulations implementing the Opportunity Zones tax incentive. Opportunity Zones, created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, offer capital gains tax relief for investments in economically distressed areas.

“Opportunity Zones are helping to revitalize communities and create jobs for hardworking Americans,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “These regulations provide clarity and certainty for investors, which will enhance the flow of capital to new and expanding businesses, and create sustained economic growth in communities that have been left behind.”

The final rules provide clarity for Opportunity Funds and their eligible subsidiaries in determining qualification and levels of new investment in Opportunity Zones. They also provide guidance regarding the types of gains that qualify for Opportunity Zone investments, as well as gains that may be excluded from tax after a 10-year holding period.

Secretary John W. Snow today appeared on CNBC to discuss the Administration's lawsuit abuse reform proposals, as well as President Bush's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. We should not raise taxes on any Americans at this time, he said. One thing we know is that the economy is in a good recovery, growing at 6 percent in the last half of last year, the fastest growth in some 20 years and to raise taxes would be imperil that recovery, to jeopardize that recovery.

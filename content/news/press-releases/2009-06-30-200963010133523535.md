As part of the Obama Administration's continued investment in economic development in communities around the country through the Recovery Act, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner announced $90 million in financial assistance awards for 59 Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) in 26 states and Puerto Rico dedicated to helping communities hard hit by the economic crisis. These awards will support new economic recovery projects in some of our nation's most vulnerable communities at a time when they are facing many financial challenges.

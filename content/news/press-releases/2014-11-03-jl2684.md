- During the October – December 2014 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $232 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $200 billion.  This borrowing estimate is $45 billion higher than announced in August 2014.  The increase in borrowing relates primarily to changes in cash balance assumptions.[1]

- During the January – March 2015 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $209 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $100 billion.

During the July – September 2014 quarter, Treasury issued $205 billion in net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $158 billion.  In August 2014, Treasury had estimated $192 billion in net marketable debt and assumed an end-of-September cash balance of $150 billion.  The increase in borrowing is driven primarily by a higher ending cash balance.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 5, 2014.

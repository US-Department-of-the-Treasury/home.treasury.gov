We are committed to defending human rights and advancing democratic governance in Venezuela through the use of financial sanctions.

We will use these tools to target those persons involved in violence against anti-government protesters, serious human rights abuses, and those involved in the arrest or prosecution of individuals for their legitimate exercise of free speech.

Corrupt actions by Venezuelan government officials deprive Venezuela of needed economic resources that could be invested in the Venezuelan people and used to spur economic growth.  These actions also undermine the public trust in democratic institutions and the human rights to which Venezuelan citizens are entitled.  This Executive Order will be used to protect the U.S. financial system from the illicit financial flows from public corruption in Venezuela.

In another step to protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system and identify rogue financial institutions, the Treasury Department today designated two foreign banks – First Merchant Bank of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and Infobank of Belarus – as financial institutions of primary money laundering concern, pursuant to Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act. We continue to use our authority under the USA PATRIOT Act to protect the U.S. financial system from corrupt financial institutions such as these, said Stuart Levey, Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.

The U.S. Treasury Department and the American Bankers Association Education Foundation once again are partnering today for the 12th annual Teach Children to Save Day. Fourteen Treasury department officials and staff members will volunteer their time to teach America's elementary and high school students the importance of saving.

This is Treasury's fifth year participating in Teach Children to Save Day, when bankers and Department officials connect with students in classrooms and after-school programs to share real life lessons about money.

The following events are open to the media:

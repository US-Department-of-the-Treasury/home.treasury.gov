FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-257



In the past six years, many in the House and Senate have supported the Administration's efforts to put gun criminals behind bars as well as prevent them from getting guns in the first place. Measures, such as the Brady Law, the Assault Weapons Ban, and expanded crime gun tracing and coordinated federal and state prosecutions of gun crimes have contributed significantly to our nation's decrease in violent crime.



Despite broad support and evidence that measures such as the Brady Law help reduce crime, the House-Senate conference committee could not complete their work to produce a Juvenile Justice Bill containing important gun safety provisions. As the final Congressional session of the 20th century concludes, the passage of meaningful legislation to reduce gun violence was frustrated.



Gun violence will continue to threaten our communities and parents will continue to fear for their children's safety until the will of the American people is carried out by enacting common sense gun legislation in the next Congressional session. We look forward to working with the Congress to pass gun safety amendments that will make our communities safer as the new century begins.

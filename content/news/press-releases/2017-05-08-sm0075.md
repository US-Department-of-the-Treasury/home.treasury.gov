**Washington**– On May 4-5, 2017, the U.S. Department of the Treasury hosted the fourth meeting of the Law Enforcement Coordination Group (LECG) focused on countering Hizballah’s terrorist and illicit activities.
  
Counterterrorism policymakers and practitioners from more than 20 governments – from across the Middle East, South America, Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, and North America – along with Europol and Interpol, participated in this LECG meeting.  The LECG session focused on Hizballah’s terrorist financing-related and criminal activities, and discussed how law enforcement and financial tools, including sanctions, could be most effectively utilized to counter these threats.   
 
“The Law Enforcement Coordination Group is a unique platform that harnesses the expertise and capacity of critical partners across the globe to counter the threat posed by Hizballah,” said Jennifer Fowler, Acting Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing.  “We are going to continue to work within the LECG to share information, collaborate, and develop strategies to disrupt Hizballah’s financial activities and support.”
 
Participating governments discussed how international cooperation against Hizballah’s terrorist and illicit activities could be improved going forward.  In addition to Treasury, officials from the U.S. State Department, Justice Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Counterterrorism Center, and Department of Homeland Security all participated in this meeting. 
 
The LECG, which was originally established in 2014, will convene for its 5th meeting in late 2017.

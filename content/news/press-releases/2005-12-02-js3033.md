The attached chart illustrates the strong job growth and falling unemployment rate since the President's economic policies have come into effect.  The American economy has created 4.4 million new jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.0% -- well below the historical average -- since the President signed the Jobs and Growth bill into law in May of 2003.  It is vital that we keep taxes low on individuals and on capital gains and dividends and resist tax hikes that could undermine the path of economic growth.

**WASHINGTON** – Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew issued the following statement today on the Administration’s release of the Cybersecurity Framework aimed at increasing cybersecurity across industries and sectors:

“Today's announcement of the Cybersecurity Framework is another important step forward in protecting our nation's critical infrastructure against cyber risks.  This set of best practices, standards, and guidelines will help organize the way firms think about cyber risks, benchmark their progress, and improve their overall preparedness.

“Although we are making substantial progress, there is still more work ahead.  Treasury is committed to working closely with the financial sector to share information and improve cybersecurity across the industry.  In addition, we remain committed to working with Congress to pass comprehensive legislation which responds to the ever changing nature of cyber threats, while protecting privacy and civil liberties.”

This milestone comes one year after President Obama signed[Executive Order 13636](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/02/12/executive-order-improving-critical-infrastructure-cybersecurity)in an effort to encourage greater private and public sector collaboration to strengthen the protection of the nation’s critical infrastructure.  In that time, Treasury has provided classified and unclassified cyber briefings to financial institutions of all sizes, streamlined information sharing between the government agencies and the private sector, and worked with industry to develop new policy measures such as the Framework.

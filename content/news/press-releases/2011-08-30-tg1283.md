**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designations of three senior officials of the Government of Syria –Syria’s Foreign and Expatriates Minister Walid Al-Moallem, Syria’s Presidential Political and Media Advisor Bouthaina Shaaban and Syria’s Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Abdul Karim Ali – pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13573.   “Building on our sanctions targeting the entire Government of Syria, we are bringing additional pressure to bear today directly on three senior Asad regime officials who are principal defenders of the regime’s activities,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.   Walid Al-Moallem was appointed Foreign and Expatriates Minister in February 2006 and Bouthaina Shaaban has served as Syria’s Presidential Political and Media Advisor since July 2008. As Syria’s primary link to Lebanon, Ali Abdul Karim Ali has served as the Syrian Ambassador to Lebanon since May 2009 and has maintained close ties to Syrian intelligence throughout his diplomatic career.   Signed by President Obama on May 18, 2011, E.O. 13573 targets senior officials of the Government of Syria.  On August 18, 2011, the President signed E.O. 13582, imposing additional sanctions – the strongest to date – against the Government of Syria and its instrumentalities, including its Central Bank and its energy sector. As a result of today’s action, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with any of the designees and any assets they may have subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.   Identifying Information:** Individual:     Al-Moallem, Walid** AKA:              MUALLEM, WALID AKA:              AL-MOUALEM, WALID AKA:              AL-MUALEM, WALID AKA:              AL-MUALLEM, WALID AKA:              MUHI EDDINE MOALLEM, WALID AKA:              MOALLEM, WALID AKA:              AL-MOUALLEM, WALID DOB:             1941 POB:              Damascus, Syria** Individual:     Shaaban, Bouthaina** AKA:               Shaaban, Buthaina DOB:              1953 POB:               Homs, Syria** Individual:     Ali Abdul Karim Ali** AKA:              Ali Abdul Karim AKA:              Ali Abd-al-Karim AKA:              Ali Abd-al-Karim Ali AKA:              Ali Abdel Karim Ali AKA:              Ali Abdulkarim Ali AKA:              Ali Abdulkarim DOB:             1953 POB:              Latakia Governorate, Syria​

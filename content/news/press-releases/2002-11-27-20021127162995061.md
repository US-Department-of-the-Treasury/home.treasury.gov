  Today the Treasury Department announced the establishment of a public web page for the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF).   The purpose of the page is to provide explanatory information on the ESF and links to official reports in which the finances and operations of the ESF are reflected.    This is the first time that such comprehensive information has been assembled in one place that is readily usable by the public.   Information in public documents on the ESF's operations and finances has long been considerable in scope, but many of these documents focus on the broader Treasury or U.S. government financial context of which the ESF is a part, rather than on the ESF itself.   Also, the Treasury regularly provides the Congress with reports on ESF operations and finances, including an annual audit report.   The new ESF web page makes such information easier to relate specifically to the ESF.     The view of the Treasury Department is that the public can benefit from a better understanding of role of the ESF and that the ESF web page will serve this purpose.    The ESF web page can be accessed at: [www.treas.gov/offices/international-affairs/esf/index.html](http://www.treas.gov/offices/international-affairs/esf/index.html)   -30-

The Treasury Department is preparing for an industry-wide exercise it will sponsor this fall, to allow the financial services sector to test its ability to respond to a pandemic crisis such as a bird flu outbreak. President Bush directed Treasury in May of 2006 to coordinate with the banking and finance sector to better prepare its response to a pandemic crisis. The 3-week, voluntary exercise will bring together the public and private sector through the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee and the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council.

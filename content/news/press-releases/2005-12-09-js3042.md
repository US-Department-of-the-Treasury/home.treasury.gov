Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will travel to Mexico City next week to meet with President Vicente Fox, Finance Minister Gil Diaz, and others. The trip is part of the ongoing dialogue with a vital economic partner on priority issues for both countries, including economic integration and cooperation and poverty reduction.



The Secretary will hold a joint press conference with Minister Diaz at 5:45 p.m. (CST) on Thursday, December 15 in the Los Pinos Conference Room at the Presidential Palace.



The Secretary will also hear the views of local business leaders, students and political commentators while in Mexico City. U.S. Treasurer Anna Escobedo Cabral will be joining the Secretary for the trip. Cabral has been active in Treasury's engagement with Mexico on a number of economic and financial education issues.

**View the Sources and Uses Table here WASHINGTON** — The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of net marketable borrowing for the October – December 2016 and January – March 2017 quarters:

- During the October – December 2016 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $188 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $390 billion.  The borrowing estimate is $6 billion higher than announced in August 2016.
 
- During the January – March 2017 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $56 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $100 billion.

During the July – September 2016 quarter, Treasury borrowed $222 billion in net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $353 billion.  In August 2016, Treasury estimated net marketable borrowing of $201 billion and assumed an end-of-September cash balance of $350 billion.  The increased borrowing was driven by a combination of modestly lower receipts, higher outlays, and the slightly higher end-of-quarter cash balance.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury's Quarterly Refunding will be released at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 2, 2016.

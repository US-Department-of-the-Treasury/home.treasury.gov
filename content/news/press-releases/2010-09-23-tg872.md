TG-872

On Tuesday afternoon, Secretary Geithner and Professor Elizabeth Warren hosted a mortgage disclosure forum at Treasury. With the improvement of disclosures for mortgages and other financial products a top priority for the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the forum brought together a broad range of stakeholders and experts to provide input on the simplification of mortgage disclosure forms so that consumers have the clear and easy-to-understand information they need to make the financial choices that are best for themselves and their families.

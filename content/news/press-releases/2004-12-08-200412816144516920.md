Deputy Secretary Samuel Bodman today signed protocols strengthening U.S.-French tax treaties on income tax and the estate tax in a signing ceremony at the Treasury Department. Today we are improving an already strong treaty relationship between the United States and France, said Bodman. These two protocols will further our goals of facilitating cross-border trade and investment to the benefit of the citizens and businesses of both our countries.

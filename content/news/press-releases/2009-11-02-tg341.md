**Washington, D.C.  --**The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of marketable borrowing for the October – December 2009 and the January – March 2010 quarters:

- During the October – December quarter, Treasury expects to issue $276 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $85 billion, which includes $15 billion for the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP).The borrowing estimate is $209 billion lower than announced in July 2009.The decrease in borrowing is primarily related to cash balance adjustments related to the SFP, and lower outlays offset partially by lower receipts.
- During the January - March quarter, Treasury expects to issue $478 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $45 billion, which includes $15 billion for the SFP.
- These estimates do not include any incremental borrowing needs that would result from a potential increase in issuance under the SFP.

During the July – September 2009 quarter, Treasury issued $393 billion in net marketable debt, finishing the quarter with a cash balance of $275 billion, of which $165 billion was attributable to the SFP.In July, Treasury had estimated $406 billion in marketable borrowing for the quarter, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $270 billion.The decrease in borrowing was primarily a result of lower outlays.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury's Quarterly Refunding will be released at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, November 4.

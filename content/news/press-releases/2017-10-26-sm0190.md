Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin made the following statement today after President Trump announced that he intends to designate Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy David Kautter as Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS):
“I look forward to having David Kautter as Acting Commissioner of the IRS. David will provide important leadership while we wait to confirm a permanent Commissioner,” said Secretary Mnuchin. “Assistant Secretary Kautter has had an illustrious 40-year career in tax policy, and I am confident that the IRS and the American people will benefit from his experience and insight.”
Current IRS Commissioner John Koskinen’s term expires on November 12, and Kautter’s designation as Acting Commissioner will take effect at that time.
Kautter joined Treasury as Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy in August 2017. He will continue to carry out his Assistant Secretary duties, including working on tax reform, while serving as Acting Commissioner. Deputy Commissioners Kirsten Wielobob and Jeff Tribiano will continue to run the day-to-day operations of the IRS, both reporting to David.

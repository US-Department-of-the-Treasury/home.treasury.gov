Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Wayne A. Abernathy will speak Thursday at an identity theft briefing sponsored by American Express.



Holidays are a great time for family, friends, and celebration, but they're also the time when identity thieves go into overdrive, said Abernathy. Fortunately, there are some simple things that Americans can do that will seriously reduce their chances of becoming financial victims.These simple things are all about being careful as you shop: know who you are doing business with; empty your purse or wallet of extra cards, checks, and identifying documents you won't need; don't let your credit card out of your sight; don't leave receipts behind or lying around and don't put them into the trash without cutting them up or shredding them; check your financial statements when they arrive and ask for them if they don't show up at their usual time.



Additionally, Abernathy reminded consumers that beginning on December 1, legislation signed by President Bush last year gives those living in the western U.S. (and then progressing across the nation through 2005) the right to a free copy of their credit report each year.



Abernathy will be joined by representatives from the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission, the Better Business Bureau, and consumer advocacy groups to discuss the growing problem of identity theft.

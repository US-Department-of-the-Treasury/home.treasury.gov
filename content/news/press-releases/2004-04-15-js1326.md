**The United States-Russia Banking Dialogue: Two Years Later**

  

I thank the Financial Services Volunteer Corps (FSVC), Rusratings, and the Regional Association of Russian Banks for putting together this excellent conference and for inviting me to participate.I would like to focus my remarks on the success of the United States-Russia Banking Dialogue and on ways in which the United States can continue to support reform and thereby encourage investment in the Russian banking sector.The Banking Dialogue is part of new economic relationship between the United States and Russia, and I would like to begin by putting the Banking Dialogue in the context of that new relationship.



**The Changed Economic Relationship Between The United States and Russia**



Two years ago this week, I traveled to Moscow to meet with the leaders of the United States–Russia Banking Dialogue as they were deciding on what reforms they would recommend to Presidents Putin and Bush at the upcoming May 2002 Summit.The Banking Dialogue had been established just a few months earlier by the two presidents at a meeting in Crawford, Texas in November 2001.They had requested that the private sector-led group develop specific, concrete recommendations for banking reform in time for the May 2002 Summit.



It is important to emphasize that the creation of the Banking Dialogue was part of a larger effort to broaden and change the economic relationship between the United States and Russia.In the 1990s that economic relationship was defined for the most part by large-scale borrowing from the West.The International Monetary Fund alone lent Russia over $20 billion.But that relationship was changing in 2001.



As the year progressed, Russian financial officials were emphasizing more and more in fora like the G-8 that they would pay government debts in full and on time, and Russia was actually prepaying the IMF.This was in sharp contrast to the large-scale borrowing, default, and periodic threats of nonpayment in 1990s.



Our economic engagement with Russia in 2001 both encouraged and reflected this new reality.There were frequent trips to Russia by the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments.In fact, my trip two years ago was my third trip to Russia in less than a year and our Treasury attaché was working overtime.Our objective was to find new ways for Russia and the United States to interact cooperatively on economic issues.We placed a great deal of emphasis on the private sector.The U.S. – Russia Banking Dialogue was a result of these efforts.It was not the only result, of course.Dialogues on Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization, on our energy relationship, and on combating terrorist financing—another high priority Treasury issue—were also parts of the new economic relationship.That Russia was now taking steps in the debt area to be a serious player in the world economy helped move the relationship in a very positive direction.



**The Success of the Banking Dialogue and Banking Reform Efforts**



From our perspective, the Banking Dialogue has been a great success.As you know the recommendations were delivered to Presidents Bush and Putin in Moscow in May 2002 as requested, thanks to the hard work of many people.They were good recommendations—they were specific and they were concrete.The recommendations focused on four general areas: 1) increasing trust and reducing risk in the financial system; 2) creating a competitive banking system; 3) increasing the economy’s access to credit, especially long-term; and 4) small and medium sized enterprise issues.



The Banking Dialogue was fortunate to benefit from participation of Andrey Kozlov, who was working for FSVC at the time on programs which helped to bring U.S. banking experts to Russia.Of course, the Banking Dialogue would not have been possible without the voluntary participation of various Russian, U.S., and other foreign bankers, some of whom are with us here today.



The timing of the Banking Dialogue was also quite good.In March 2002 President Putin nominated and the Duma approved a new reform-minded team at the Central Bank of Russia, led by Sergei Ignatiev and including Andrey Kozlov.As a result of their efforts progress has been made in some key areas, even in face of continued opposition to reform.



Let me first comment on some of the achievements.



Deposit Insurance.



The recent passage of deposit insurance legislation is a major accomplishment and essential first step to modernizing Russian banking sector.It is also at the heart of the first goal of the Banking Dialogue recommendations: increasing trust and reducing risk.



We agree with Deputy Governor Kozlov when he said bringing deposit insurance law to life is the key to strengthening the banking system.Enhancing depositor confidence will help bring “mattress” savings – which could be as much as $50 billion -- into the formal financial sector, money that can be used for new lending and increasing economic growth.To ensure safe operations of the deposit insurance fund, it will be critical to permit coverage only to banks meeting a fit and proper test.Russian banks need to recognize benefits of deposit insurance and support the implementation of robust criteria for entry into the system.The U.S. Treasury has a resident advisor in Moscow helping set up the deposit insurance agency.



New Approach to Supervision.



Just as important is the Central Bank of Russia’s broader, more fundamental shift in supervisory philosophy.It aims to establish modern, forward-looking banking supervision in line with international best practices.Examples of this new approach include the development of regulations through greater consultation with commercial banks, increased transparency, the introduction of a CAMEL-like system for rating banks, and the use of qualitative judgments on risk and bank soundness.Again this is very much in the spirit of the Banking Dialogue recommendations.This shift does not grab headlines like passage of key legislation, but in concert with implementation of other reforms, it will exert a fundamental and positive impact on fostering a healthy and vibrant banking system.



These are significant achievements, but at the same time, there are items on the list of the Banking Dialogue recommendations that still need to be addressed.



Accounting reform.



One area of concern is the postponement of the introduction of modern accounting standards.The movement of banks and their clients to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is important for improving governance, and transparency.For Russian banks, it will provide greater confidence to potential foreign partners and give Russian bank managers an additional tool for understanding their operations and making strategic decisions.We recognize the transition takes time.However, the Russian authorities need to avoid further delays and stick to an agreed timetable.



Privatization.



Another area of concern is the lack of progress on state bank privatization.Russia needs a strong, private commercial banking system.State banks do not by and large make lending decisions on market terms and they keep the playing field uneven for private banks.Until Russia makes basic decisions to shrink the dominant role of the state banks in the system, Russia will not have an efficient, growth-promoting mechanism for intermediating the country’s savings.Unfortunately, the government has not followed through on its privatization commitments in the joint banking reform strategy.



With respect to the privatization of Vneshtorgbank, the decision to sell stakes in the bank to the EBRD and IFC is the right one.The EBRD and IFC can help ensure that a follow sale to a strategic private investor meets international standards.



In the case of Sberbank, the decision to limit the state guarantee and to bring the bank into deposit insurance system by end-2005 is a step in the right direction.With Sberbank’s market share of retail deposits at 65% and falling, the timing seems appropriate.The next step is for the government to develop a more detailed strategy and timeframe on the bank’s privatization.



Banking Opportunities.



If reform is accelerated, it should help create an environment in which Russian banks can take advantage of opportunities presented by Russia’s rapidly growing economy.Thus far, foreign banks have limited their exposure to the Russian market and many Russian banks have missed the recent boom entirely.Larger corporations are now going abroad for financing.The loan to GDP ratio is less than 20 percent, well below those of more advanced transition economies and other major emerging markets.Loans to GDP in more advanced Central European economies average roughly 35 percent.In the United States, the level is roughly 75 percent.In Germany, it is 130 percent.



Over the last two years, there has been an explosion of new banking services including consumer lending and mortgages.Foreign and Russian banks are moving forward and could do even more with the proper policy framework in place.New opportunities for Russian, U.S. and other foreign banks are opening up with clients outside the natural resource sector that do not have access to international capital markets or pocket banks.Further development of the banking system infrastructure such as an interbank market and local syndication market will allow banks to better pursue these opportunities.This will require banks themselves to adopt corporate governance and transparency standards which meet international best practices.



**U.S. Policy Priorities and Support**



The United States is continuing to support reform and development of the banking sector in a variety of ways:



First, the United States is pushing for level-playing field and equal access for U.S. and other foreign banks to Russian market as part of WTO negotiations.It is only through competition with foreign banks—which bring best practices and technology—that Russian banks can reach their potential.Russia could use the WTO accession negotiations to send an important signal to foreign investors and bolster competition by committing to allow foreign banks to branch into Russia and to permit foreign banks established in Russia to compete on an equal footing with Russian-owned banks.This, in the minimum, requires that Russia place no limits on foreign equity participation in the sector.



Second, the United States supports the development of new financial markets and products.The recent data on the growth of retail and mortgage lending and leasing are encouraging.We believe the U.S.-Russia Investment Fund’s mortgage subsidiary, Delta Capital, has played a leading role in the Russian mortgage market by providing over $100 million in loans both directly and through partner banks.Undoubtedly, this success has encouraged other Russian competitors.The United States is also a strong proponent of IFC and EBRD projects, which promote competition by lending and making equity investments in Russian regional banks that are well-placed to provide new financial services to underserved regions and business sectors.



Third, we continue to focus on increasing credit to small business and programs that help banks to lend to this market.The United States government has contributed $40 million to the EBRD’s Russia Small Business Fund, which has built one major small business bank -- KMB Bank -- and is partnering with other banks to build their small business portfolios.Finance Minster Kudrin has said that “EBRD’s Russia Small Business Fund has been successful in increasing the capacity of banks to lend to small and micro businesses, which is critical to the growth of the SME sector.”The program as a whole has provided over 180,000 loans worth over $1.6 billion to small businesses in 128 cities throughout Russia.



**Next Steps for U.S. Engagement**



The United States hopes to do more.Continuing our direct engagements with our government counterparts in Russia, and supplementing these with private sector expertise through organizations such as the FSVC, will continue to be an important part of our approach.Following on our support for mortgage lending, we are interested in working with the Russia to develop a mortgage-backed security market.This is an area where the United States can be helpful and representatives from the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Treasury and State are engaged in active discussions with the key Russian officials – the state housing agency, the finance ministry, the central bank and the securities commission.



In addition, the U.S.-Russia Banking Dialogue is working to implement one of its own recommendations, which called for more direct interaction between the Russian and international financial communities.More specifically, the United States is interested in promoting greater exchanges between our two financial communities by supporting the FSVC’s internship program through its arrangements with the U.S. Agency for International Development and, potentially, the Commerce Department’s SABIT program.The next round of FSVC internships start this summer and we are proud to be a part of that.



**Conclusion**



The path of banking sector reform will be a key test of the Russian government’s commitment to spreading the benefits of growth more broadly among the Russian people.



The beginning of President Putin’s second term may well mark a fundamental turning point in Russia’s economic path.Whether the new direction will be toward more economic diversification, competition, and free markets is still not clear, though President Putin’s emphasis on lowering tax rates and a stable investment climate set a very promising tone.



Diversification—in which new businesses in new sectors grow up around the old Soviet industrial base and the new energy conglomerates—is the only realistic path for achieving President Putin’s ambitious goal of doubling Russia’s GDP in ten years.Any state-directed attempt to achieve goal of economic diversification will ultimately be less effective, insufficient and ultimately unsustainable.



Thus, the development of a vibrant, internationally competitive, private banking sector is essential for overall reform progress.Our continuing engagement with Russia on banking reform is testament to the strength of this conviction.

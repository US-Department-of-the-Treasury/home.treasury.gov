**Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce – 2004 Brazil SummitWaldorf Astoria HotelNew York, New YorkApril 27, 2004United States-Brazil Cooperation to Increase Economic Growth**It is a pleasure to be part of this important gathering this year.The timing for theSummitcould not be better from my perspective.I returned late last week fromBrazilwhere along with Joaquim Levy and Marcos Lisboa of Minister Antonio Palocci´s team, we convened the second meeting of the U.S.-Brazil Group for Growth.

As many of you may know, the Group for Growth was announced by President Bush and President Lula last June as a forum to discuss strategies for economic growth and job creation in both countries.The Group for Growth is a “two-way,” candid, substantive exchange.I reviewed strategies in the United Statesto promote economic growth, including President Bush’s marginal tax rate cuts and his tort reform proposal.Joaquim Levy and Marcos Lisboa reviewed progress on President Lula’s efforts to raise growth inBrazil.The positive impact of a strong and growingU.S.economy on the global economy, particularly theWestern Hemisphere, is evident.And there is no question that the tremendous potential of the Brazilian economy, with its vast size and resources, can be an engine of growth forLatin Americaand the world.

The Group´s first meeting was held inWashingtonlast August.That meeting focused on productivity growth—how it is measured and what factors support higher rates of productivity growth and rising living standards.At last week’s meeting, we focused on the foundations for higher productivity growth.These include sound fiscal and monetary policies, investment, and an environment where small and medium businesses can flourish.Let me start with a few words about the macroeconomic policies that constitute the bedrock of the foundation of productivity growth.

**Macroeconomic Policies under the Lula Administration**Before assuming office, President Lula announced his commitment to a fiscal policy that would honor Brazil´s obligations and keepBrazilon a fiscally sustainable path.This commitment to fiscal responsibility—including an increase of the primary surplus to 4.25 percent of GDP for 2003—was made at the height of market uncertainty about the direction of economic policy under the new Administration.

During the first year in office, President Lula’s government went on to beat that 2003 primary surplus target.President Lula also presided over passage of a politically difficult but highly necessary reform of the public employee pension system and the first stage of a tax reform.His government has moved to reduce the indexation of government securities to the exchange rate, thereby limiting the debt stock’s sensitivity to the external environment.All of these efforts demonstrate the government’s firm resolve to bring downBrazil’s debt to GDP ratio.

Sound fiscal policy has been complemented by strong monetary policy.A low inflation environment lowers uncertainty and reduces borrowing costs.Low inflation also protects the poorest segments of Brazilian society, who are most vulnerable to inflation.

When President Lula was inaugurated in January 2003, inflation expectations for the upcoming year were running in excess of 13 percent, following the 35 percent*real*depreciation and 12.5 percent inflation in 2002.Thanks to careful monetary management by Brazil’s central bank within the inflation-targeting framework, actual inflation in 2003 was 9.3 percent and inflation expectations for 2004 have fallen to about 6 percent (well within the target band of 5.5 percent ± 2.5 percent).

The result of these good fiscal and monetary policies has been a dramatic improvement in financial markets.Brazil’s sovereign risk spread has fallen from a high of 2,400 basis points over U.S. Treasuries in the fall of 2002 to about 600 basis points today.After falling to 4.0*reais *per U.S. dollar in the fall of 2002, the*real *now stands at around 2.9 per dollar and has been stable for the past year.

The impact of greater stability onBrazil’s fiscal position is already apparent:consolidated interest expense has declined from 13.9 percent of GDP during the first two months of 2003 to 8.2 percent for the same period in 2004.It is expected to decline further over the course of the year, improving the overall fiscal balance and reducingBrazil’s need for additional borrowing.

More importantly, improved confidence in fiscal policy and the downward trend in inflationary expectations have enabled the central bank to cut interest rates over the last 10 months.Real interest rates are now less than 10 percent.Indeed, the positive impact of lower rates on investment and production is already being felt; they were certainly a key factor driving growth in the fourth quarter of 2003 to an annualized rate of 6.1 percent.

Another key contributor was strong export growth.Brazil’s exports grew 21 percent last year, and the monthly data so far this year have continued to beat expectations.A significant portion of export growth has been driven by new markets, withChinabeing a prominent destination.Importantly, key export sectors have boosted investment in response to increased demand and have developed new markets around the world.

In addition to driving economic growth, the expansion of Brazilian exports also helps reduce the country’s external vulnerability by building foreign exchange earnings.Along with the Brazilian central bank’s efforts to boost reserves, the growth of exports helps to cushionBrazilfrom unexpected shocks in international capital markets.

Perhaps the most striking aspect of the current macroeconomic environment is that it has been fostered by the party that for so many years was the opposition in Brazilian politics.This represents an important turning point inBrazil:there is broad consensus on the centrality of sound macroeconomic policies as a prerequisite to sustainable, robust economic growth.

**Microeconomic Reforms for Achieving Higher Economic Growth **Building on the bedrock of improved macroeconomic stability, Brazilians have moved microeconomic reform to the fore of the policy agenda for increasing economic growth.The Group for Growth is proving to be an excellent venue for advancing discussions about these issues.Let me provide a few examples from our recent meeting.***Reducing the Cost of Credit***

Most Brazilian businesses must pay high interest rates to borrow locally.Macroeconomic factors are an important part of the explanation for this phenomenon.High levels of government borrowing in the past have meant that public debt—rather than loans to the private sector—have come to represent a high proportion of bank assets.High real interest rates and macroeconomic instability have also discouraged private borrowing.This is why the Lula Administration’s emphasis on lowering public debt and reducing real interest rates is an essential foundation for expanding bank credit to businesses for investment.

But macroeconomic policy alone is not sufficient.Intermediation spreads—the difference between banks’ cost of funds and their lending rates—are also extremely high, due to microeconomic factors that impede financial intermediation.As a result,Brazilhas a relatively low level of financial intermediation—domestic bank credit to the private sector constitutes just 35 percent of GDP compared to 66 percent inChileand even higher levels in the fast-growing economies ofEast Asia.

Reducing these spreads and expanding business lending is a major objective of President Lula’s economic team.The Administration’s proposed bankruptcy reform is designed to enhance creditor rights by facilitating the reorganization of bankrupt entities.As a result, a company can continue to operate, while servicing its obligations to creditors.Additional reforms call for broader access to credit records and seek the application of anti-trust laws to the financial sector.These measures will boost transparency and increase access to information, critical components to a more competitive and deeper financial sector.Emphasizing the legal security of contracts and fostering the development of new financial products, in mortgage and insurance markets for instance, will also contribute to the deepening of credit inBrazil.

***Expanding Credit to Small Businesses***

The government is giving particular attention to the challenge of expanding access to credit for small businesses.At last week’s Group for Growth meeting, we discussed how the successful experiences of theEuropeanBankfor Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)and transition economies in promoting bank lending to small businesses can inform the Brazilian government’s efforts in this area.The EBRD’s programs provide technical assistance and new techniques to lending institutions in order to train staff on best practices in small business lending.These techniques streamline lending procedures, lowering transaction costs and replacing collateral-based and/or directed lending with proper credit analysis.Loans under these programs are profitable, market-based, and they are repaid at a rate of 99.7 percent.At theSummitof theAmericasinMonterrey, the United Statesled the effort to establish the goal of tripling lending to small and medium businesses using these techniques.

***Reducing Time to Start a Business***

In addition to promoting access to credit,Brazilcan help encourage entrepreneurs by reducing the time and cost it takes to start a business.Currently, it takes 158 days to start a business inBrazil, in large part because of the need to gain numerous approvals at every level of government—federal, state, and municipal.The Lula government is now embarking on a program to streamline and simplify the process of business registration, which ultimately will require a business to register only once.The aim is to have federal, state and municipal governments all use the same registration form, saving the business and the government considerable time, effort and money.

***Increasing Investment***

The clear message fromBrazil’s leadership is that higher levels of investment are needed forBrazilto realize its growth potential.EvaluatingBrazil’s economic performance over the long term, one sees a strong relationship between capital accumulation and productivity growth.Capital accumulation declined in the beginning of the 1980s, and although economic reforms in the early 1990s helped increase investment rates and productivity growth, the level of investment as a percentage of GDP remains low at 19 percent.

The government has outlined a series of measures to help increase investment.For instance, the government plans to exempt new investment accounts from distortive financial transaction taxes to encourage domestic savings that can be used to fund productive investment.It also plans to reduce the tax burden on capital goods, thereby encouraging firms to invest and expand their productive capacity.

The government also clearly places a priority on public infrastructure spending.It is considering measures to increase public investment within a framework of reduced spending in other areas.Recent trends support the view that priority be given to productive infrastructure investment.At the same time, fiscal accounting should include all expenditures, current as well as capital, while not penalizing growth-enhancing public investment

The government’s role in establishing the right environment for investment is central.Clear and predictable regulatory and legal environments will be absolutely critical to attracting the private investment thatBrazilwill need in areas such as energy and transportation.

**Conclusion**I have focused on a few elements of the microeconomic reform agenda discussed in last week’s Group for Growth, but these are only part of the agenda.Additional efforts are underway on labor, judicial, and tax reform—all of which are important to establishing an environment that encourages investment and job creation.

This clearly is not a short-term project.It is one that will require considerable focus and patience.Adherence to sound macroeconomic policy will continue to provide the necessary foundation on which the success of these reforms rests.My discussions in the Group for Growth convince me that President Lula and his economic team are determined to achieve this success.

I would like to thank Minister Palocci for his support of the Group for Growth.It has provided a great opportunity for our two governments to work together more closely, share experiences, and craft policies for promoting higher economic growth and more jobs in both of our countries.We share a common view of the foundation for growth and poverty reduction:sound public finances and low inflation, investment in people, and support for entrepreneurship.I look forward to our next meeting of the Group later this year.

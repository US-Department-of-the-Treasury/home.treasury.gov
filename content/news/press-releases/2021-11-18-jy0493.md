WASHINGTON — Today, President Biden signed an Executive Order (E.O.) terminating the national emergency with respect to Burundi and revoking E.O. 13712, which has authorized sanctions with respect to Burundi since 2015.  As a result, the economic sanctions with respect to Burundi administered by the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) are no longer in effect.  These steps were taken in light of changed circumstances and positive political developments in Burundi, including the reforms pursued by President Ndayishimiye since he took office.

“The United States recognizes the positive reforms pursued by President Ndayishimiye, while continuing to press the Government of Burundi to improve the human rights situation in the country and hold accountable those responsible for violations and abuses,” said Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo.  “President Biden’s action today demonstrates that, consistent with the findings of Treasury’s 2021 Sanctions Review, we are committed to the use of economic sanctions in coordination with diplomacy and other tools of statecraft towards a clear and specific objective.  Further, the United States may ease or remove sanctions when circumstances warrant such an adjustment, including in cases where relevant parties change their behavior.”

The President’s E.O. of November 18, 2021, “Termination of Emergency With Respect to the Situation in Burundi,” terminated the national emergency declared in E.O. 13712 and revoked that E.O.  As a result of the revocation of E.O. 13712:

- All persons blocked solely pursuant to the Burundi Sanctions Regulations have been removed from OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List;
- All property and interests in property blocked solely pursuant to the Burundi Sanctions Regulations are unblocked; and
- OFAC will remove the Burundi Sanctions Regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations at a future date.

Pending or future OFAC enforcement investigations or actions related to apparent violations of the Burundi Sanctions Regulations that occurred while E.O. 13712 was in effect may still be carried out.

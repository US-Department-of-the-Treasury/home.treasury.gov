Harrisburg
– U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today in response to President Trump's tax reform speech in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania:
"Today the President stood with nearly 1,000 hardworking men and women in Pennsylvania to reaffirm our commitment to give America's workers lower taxes and a pay raise.  We know that by making the individual tax code simpler and fairer, and by making our business tax rates more competitive, we will deliver tax reform that Americans deserve, but which they have not had in over 30 years.
"In the President's speech, we saw how passionate he is when talking to the people who are the backbone of our economic system, but who have been forgotten by Washington.  By leveling the playing field through tax reform, we will put money back in the pockets of middle-income families and workers.
"We are working with Congress to pass historic tax relief and reform that will invigorate American manufacturing and ensure that the many truckers who attended the President's speech today will have plenty of American-made goods to deliver to every corner of our nation."

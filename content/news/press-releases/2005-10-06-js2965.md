**Before the Committee on Foreign Relations**



Chairman Lugar, Senator Biden, and distinguished Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today.I am grateful to President Bush for my nomination to serve as the United States Alternate Executive Director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.If confirmed, it will be an honor to serve under Secretary Snow and work with the Treasury Department to help ensure thatAmerica's investments in the World Bank stimulate growth and reduce poverty in developing countries throughout the world.



This is a critical time in the history of the World Bank. The international community is facing profound challenges in fighting acute poverty, disease and strife. At the same time, President Bush has made unprecedented commitments to development and democracy throughout the world; the U.S. Congress, with the leadership of this Committee, has provided historic levels of support; and Mr. Wolfowitz brings strong leadership to an institution with an increasingly complex and vital mission.



It has been my privilege to enjoy a life-long career in public service.I have held leadership positions in a wide range of not-for-profit and government organizations, from the Federal Transit Administration to the American Red Cross; from the NationalHealthMuseum to the U.S. Department of Labor.I have been honored to work for and with people, like Senator Dole, who are dedicated to making a difference in the lives of people in need.



In its many ambitious and important projects, the World Bank strives to promote economic growth, while living up to the highest standards of financial stewardship; to improve the quality of life of millions of people in need, while protecting the environment.This mission is both inspiring and extraordinarily difficult.



Notwithstanding my passion for the mission of the World Bank, I recognize that wanting to do good is not enough; results are the true measure of success and measurement of results is critical to insure that taxpayer investment domestic or international produce the intended effect.At the Federal Transit Administration, for example, I put into place a system of executive performance accountabilities tied to the effectiveness of a $7 billion annual investment in public transportation.



Among the important results we identified, none was more meaningful than living up to the President's charge to bring back New York after the horrific events of September 11.Our urgent mission was to expeditiously deliver and ensure good stewardship of $4.5 billion appropriated by Congress to restore and rebuild the transportation infrastructure destroyed in Lower Manhattan.Like the other transit projects already underway in Lower Manhattan, this project will help drive economic growth; it will be delivered on time and within budget; and it will be completed with careful attention to complex environmental challenges and the importance of honoring the memory of the victims of September 11.



To ensure rigorous financial discipline, we developed and utilized a risk assessment and management tool that is now an essential component of FTA's evaluation of major capital projects.To minimize negative environmental impacts while expediting these critical projects, we pioneered an effective partnership among Federal, State and local stakeholders that recognized the potential impacts of the multiple construction projects that would be underway simultaneously inLower Manhattan.And to help protect the sanctity of theWorldTradeCentersite, we reached out to the victims' families and the affected community as project plans were developed. And I am proud to say,just weeks ago Transportation Secretary Mineta broke ground for the new transit station that will serve millions of passengers at the World Trade Center site.



The challenges we faced in rebuildingNew York Citywere not unique.We knew, as the World Bank knows, that we would find better solutions by building strong partnerships.



As for my International experience, when I was senior vice president of the American Red Cross, I oversaw its international disaster relief and assistance to victims of war.Among other responsibilities, I served as the American Red Cross lead representative to the Federation, composed of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies from 154 countries, and served on its Executive Committee.In addition, I was personally asked and agreed to serve on an international commission to resolve differences between the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (Federation), to ensure that humanitarian relief efforts could proceed effectively during conflict situations.



During my tenure at the Red Cross, the world faced devastation of unimaginable proportions in Africa, the former Soviet republics, and Armenia.I was awed by the generosity and good will of the American people as they supported Red Cross relief efforts. Today, we are dealing with back-to-back natural disasters in our own country with great confidence that those affected will be able to rebuild their lives.Our confidence in America's resilience is rooted in our commitment to the principles that have been articulated by President Bush as the foundation for effective international aid, as well.As the President has reminded us, Where there is freedom and the rule of law, every dollar of aid, trade, charitable giving, and foreign and local investment can rapidly improve people's lives.



InAmerica, we have established the fundamental building blocks that you, Mr. Chairman, have recognized as critical to the effectiveness of the investments that American taxpayers make through the World Bank.Fighting corruption and increasing transparency are key priorities of theU.S.government at the World Bank. Your leadership in this arena has made a vital contribution to the efforts of the World Bank and other multilateral banks to improve living conditions around the world.And it has inspired the World Bank to establish some of the highest standards of ethics and stewardship in its own operations.Nonetheless, our work must be expanded because corruption, where it exists, is complex and deeply rooted.



If confirmed, I will dedicate the full measure of my leadership experience to ensuring that the high expectations established by the President and this Committee are achieved.Like President Bush, I believe that Economic aid that expects little will achieve little.Economic aid that expects much can help to change the world.



Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

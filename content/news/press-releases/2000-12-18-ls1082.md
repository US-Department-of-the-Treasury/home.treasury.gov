LS-1082



We welcome and support today's agreement between the International Monetary Fund and Argentina and the announcement of support by the managements of the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank.



We encourage the Government of Argentina to fully implement its enhanced commitments under the new program, which will help position Argentina for a restoration of confidence and renewed growth.

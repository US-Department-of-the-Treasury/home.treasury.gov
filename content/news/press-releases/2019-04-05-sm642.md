U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today on Treasurer of the United States Jovita Carranza’s nomination as Administrator of the Small Business Administration:
“Jovita Carranza is exceptionally qualified to lead the Small Business Administration. As Treasurer of the United States, Jovita played an important role in the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced taxes on small businesses to the lowest level in nearly eighty years and led to the strongest U.S. economy and job markets in generations. Jovita’s experience—including time as Deputy Administrator for the Small Business Administration—will be an asset to President Trump and the SBA, as they continue to promote pro-growth economic policies, eliminate job killing regulations, and fight for the small businesses that are the lifeblood of the American economy.”

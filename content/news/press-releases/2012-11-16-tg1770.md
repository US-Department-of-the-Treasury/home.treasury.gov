The CPP Securities that will be sold in the auction may not be offered or sold absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from, applicable securities law. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the CPP Securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which, or to any persons to whom, such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.   # # #

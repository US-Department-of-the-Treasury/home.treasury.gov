FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
JS-971
Treasury Secretary John Snow and Commerce Secretary Don Evans today expressed their strong support for passage of legislation to make the Internet tax moratorium permanent.  The moratorium applies to taxes on Internet access, regardless of the speed of that access, and to multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.
We believe that government should support the widespread availability and use of the Internet, including the use of broadband technology, and not discourage the Internets growth through new access taxes.  Keeping the Internet free of multiple or discriminatory taxes will help create an environment for innovation and will help ensure that electronic commerce remains a vital, and growing, part of our economy.  A permanent moratorium means a permanent victory for American consumers and businesses.
We urge the Senate to pass S. 150 as soon as possible so President Bush can sign a permanent Internet tax moratorium.

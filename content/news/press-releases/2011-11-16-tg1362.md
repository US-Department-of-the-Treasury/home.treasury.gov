**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for September 2011.  The next release, which will report on data for October 2011, is scheduled for December 15, 2011.   Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in September — net purchases were $65.8 billion.  Net purchases by private foreign investors were $28.5 billion, and net purchases by foreign official institutions were $37.3 billion.   At the same time, U.S. residents decreased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net sales of $2.7 billion.   Taking into account transactions in both foreign and U.S. securities, the net foreign purchases of long-term securities were $68.6 billion.  After adjustments, such as estimates of unrecorded principal payments to foreigners on U.S. asset-backed securities are included, the overall net foreign acquisition of long-term securities is estimated to have been $57.6 billion in September.   Foreigners increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $3.3 billion.Foreign holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities decreased by $4.8 billion.   Banks’ own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased by $4.6 billion.   In sum, the net foreign acquisition of long-term securities, the change in foreign holdings of short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows yielded monthly net TIC inflows of $57.4 billion. Of this, net foreign private inflows were $71.0 billion, and net foreign official outflows were $13.6 billion.   Complete data are available on the Treasury website at: [https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system](https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system)

Foreign purchases of foreign securities = U.S. sales of foreign securities to foreigners. Thus negative entries indicate net U.S. purchases of foreign securities, or an outflow of capital from the United States; positive entries indicate net U.S. sales of foreign securities. /5 Minus estimated unrecorded principal repayments to foreigners on domestic corporate and agency asset-backed securities + estimated foreign acquisitions of U.S. equity through stock swaps - estimated U.S. acquisitions of foreign equity through stock swaps + increase in nonmarketable Treasury Bonds and Notes Issued to Official Institutions and Other Residents of Foreign Countries. /6 These are primarily data on monthly changes in banks' and broker/dealers' custody liabilities. Data on custody claims are collected quarterly and published in the Treasury Bulletin and the TIC website. /7 "Selected Other Liabilities" are primarily the foreign liabilities of U.S. customers that are managed by U.S. banks or broker/dealers. /8 TIC data cover most components of international financial flows, but do not include data on direct investment flows, which are collected and published by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In addition to the monthly data summarized here, the TIC collects quarterly data on some banking and nonbanking assets and liabilities. Frequently Asked Question 1 on the TIC website describes the scope of TIC data collection.

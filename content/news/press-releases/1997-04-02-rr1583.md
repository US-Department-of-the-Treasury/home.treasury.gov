Thelaw enforcement missions of the Secret Service are many andvaried. In addition to the protective services that the SecretService provides for the President, Vice President and otherdesignated protectees the Service maintains its status as aleading agency in the prevention and investigation ofcounterfeiting and other financial crimes.

Ittakes a leader with special talents and dedication to oversee abureau with such vital responsibilities. The events over the pastfew years alone show how Director Bowron met that challenge.

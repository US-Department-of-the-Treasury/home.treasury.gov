​ **SEOUL** – U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew released a statement following the signing today of a $1 billion loan guarantee agreement for Ukraine in Kyiv:   “Today’s signing marks the third $1 billion U.S. loan guarantee agreement for Ukraine and underscores the continued support of the United States for Ukraine’s economic reform agenda.   “The third $1 billion loan guarantee from the United States provides direct support for Ukraine's continued progress in implementing critical economic and governance reforms.  Sustained implementation of the reform agenda—including decisive steps to professionalize government institutions, fight corruption, and reform state-owned enterprises—is essential to encouraging investment, growing jobs, and creating opportunity for the Ukrainian people.  We look forward to continuing our strong support for these efforts.”   # # #

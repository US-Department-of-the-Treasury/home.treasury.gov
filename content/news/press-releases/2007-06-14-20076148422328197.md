Secretary Paulson delivered remarks in New York City this week before the Council on Foreign Relations on the Treasury Department's role in national security. His remarks focused on Treasury's efforts to safeguard the financial system from abuse by terrorists, proliferators, rogue regimes, and other bad actors. Treasury's strategy uses conduct-based, intelligence-grounded, targeted financial measures to harness the power of the private sector and form the basis of multilateral coalitions, adding an innovative financial dimension to our national security effort, said Paulson.

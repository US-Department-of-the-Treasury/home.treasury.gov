Under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, passed by the U.S. House and Senate last week, workers will not need to take any action to have their withholding adjusted.  Their paychecks should reflect the tax relief as soon as employers and payroll processors implement the new withholding tables.  Employers should implement the withholding reductions as soon as they receive the new withholding materials.  Revised withholding information will be posted on the IRS web site on date the bill is signed and mailed to all employers by mid-June.

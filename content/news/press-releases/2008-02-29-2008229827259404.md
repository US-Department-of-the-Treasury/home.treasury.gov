The Department of the Treasury was honored Friday by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) for the historic restoration and appropriate modernization of the Treasury Building. ACHP Chairman John L. Nau, III presented Treasury's Director of Facilities and Support Services James Thomas with the Chairman's Award for Federal Achievement in Historic Preservation. The Treasury Department completed a ten year, four-phase restoration and modernization project in October of 2006, the first in almost 100 years. Many of the most historic features of the building have been carefully restored and in some cases presented in ways that have not been seen since the early 1860s.

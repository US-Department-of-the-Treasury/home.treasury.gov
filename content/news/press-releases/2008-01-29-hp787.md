I commend the House for quick bipartisan action today on an economic growth package that is simple, temporary, broad-based and effective. If enacted quickly, as I hope it will be, the House package will inject money into our economy in time to help create more than 500,000 jobs before the end of the year.



I am confident that Senate leaders understand that speed and simplicity are key to getting a bipartisan agreement enacted. The time to act is now.

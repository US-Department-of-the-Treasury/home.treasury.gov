“The bipartisan final approval of Trade Promotion Authority will help create new opportunities for American workers and U.S. businesses.  Trade Promotion Authority is critical to concluding 21st century trade agreements that support good American jobs, and ensuring that our trading partners embrace the high standards and protections that we uphold here in the United States.  I am also pleased that Congress passed Trade Adjustment Assistance, which each year will provide 100,000 workers, on average, with access to vital job training and other job-related assistance, and the African Growth and Opportunity Act, a program central to our trade relationship with Africa.  I encourage Congress to swiftly work on, and pass, trade enforcement legislation that includes robust tools to address unfair trading practices and deal with countries that break the rules.”   ###

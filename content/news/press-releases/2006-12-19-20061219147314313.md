The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Mohammed Al Ghabra, a naturalized British citizen who provides material and logistical support to al Qaida and other terrorist organizations. Mohammed Al Ghabra has backed al Qaida and other violent jihadist groups, facilitating travel for recruits seeking to meet with al Qaida leaders and take part in terrorist training, said Adam Szubin, Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). We must act against those who fund and facilitate al Qaida's agenda of violence against innocents.

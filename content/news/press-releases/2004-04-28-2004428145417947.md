Secretary Snow today joined Commerce Secretary Evans, Labor Secretary Chao and Trade Representative Zoellick in a joint press conference on trade issues. The Administration maintains that the international trading system works best with free trade, the free flow of capital and with currency values set in open, competitive markets, said Snow. The most effective way at this time to achieve the goal of a flexible, market-based exchange rate in China is to maintain the persistent engagement we have established rather than through a trade petition. Economic isolationism does not work and it's a path we will not follow.[Click here for Snow's statement](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/js1483)

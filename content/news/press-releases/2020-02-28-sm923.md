**Washington**– - Preliminary data from the June 2019 benchmark survey of foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. securities were released today on the Treasury website at[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/shlreports.aspx](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx).  Final survey results, which will include additional detail as well as possible revisions to the preliminary data, will be reported on April 30, 2020.  The survey was undertaken jointly by Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  The next annual survey will cover holdings at the end of June 2020; preliminary data are expected to be released by February 26, 2021.

Complementary surveys measuring U.S. holdings of foreign securities are also carried out annually.  Data from the most recent survey, reporting on securities held at year-end 2019, are currently being processed.  Preliminary results are expected to be reported by August 31, 2020.

### Overall Preliminary Results

The survey measured the value of foreign holdings of U.S. securities as of June 30, 2019, to be $20,858 billion, with $8,899 billion held in U.S. equities, $11,035 billion held in U.S. long-term debt securities [1] (of which $1,447 billion are holdings of asset-backed securities (ABS) [2] and $9,589 billion are holdings of non-ABS securities), and $924 billion held in U.S. short-term debt securities.  The previous survey, conducted as of June 30, 2018, measured the value of total foreign holdings of U.S. securities at $19,400 billion, with holdings of $8,139 billion in U.S. equities, $10,282 billion in U.S. long-term debt securities, and $980 billion in U.S. short-term debt securities (see Table A).

[1].Long-term debt securities have an*original *term-to-maturity of over one year.

[2].Asset-backed securities are backed by pools of assets, such as pools of residential home mortgages or credit card receivables, which give the security owners claims against the cash flows generated by the underlying assets.  Unlike most other debt securities, these securities generally repay both principal and interest on a regular basis, reducing the principal outstanding with each payment cycle.

The Bush administration today called on Congress to enact comprehensive postal reform to ensure that the United States Postal Service can continue to provide affordable and reliable universal service, while limiting exposure of taxpayers and operating appropriately in the competitive marketplace.  United States Postal Service reform should be guided by a set of clear principles outlined by the administration:

**Implement Best Practices: ** Ensure that the Postal Service’s governing body is equipped to meet the responsibilities and objectives of an enterprise of its size and scope.** Transparency: ** Ensure that important factual information on the Postal Service’s product costs and performance is accurately measured and made available to the public in a timely manner.** Flexibility: ** Ensure that the Postal Service’s governing body and management have the authority to reduce costs, set rates, and adjust key aspects of its business in order to meet its obligations to customers in a dynamic marketplace.** Accountability: ** Ensure that a Postal Service operating with greater flexibility has appropriate independent oversight to protect consumer welfare and universal mail service.** Self Financing:** Ensure that a Postal Service operating with greater flexibility is financially self-sufficient, covering all of its obligations.

I commend the Senate on today's vote. This is an important bipartisan accomplishment that will give U.S. businesses and exporters access to Peru's markets. Free trade agreements are a proven way to increase exports of U.S. goods and agricultural products and are essential for continued job creation and protecting U.S. investments. This vote signals the United States' commitment to reducing trade barriers and spreading prosperity in the hemisphere. I look forward to working with Congress to secure passage of the other important pending free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.

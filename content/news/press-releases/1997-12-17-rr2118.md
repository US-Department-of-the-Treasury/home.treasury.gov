We welcome the policy actions announced last night by Prime Minister Hashimoto to strengthen domestic demand, including a 2 trillion yen cut in personal income taxes. A strong economic recovery in Japan, led by domestic demand, is important for both our countries, for Asia, and for the world economy. We also welcome the proposals by the Japanese authorities to strengthen the financial system and urge them to move forward quickly to implement those proposals.

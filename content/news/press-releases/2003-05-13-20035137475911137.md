Treasury Secretary John Snow and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan this morning unveiled the new $20 note at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. Secretary Snow remarked at the event, I’m looking forward to the unveiling of the new currency design. I’m also looking forward to the passage of President Bush’s Jobs and Growth Plan, which will enable Americans to keep more of these new bills in their own pockets.

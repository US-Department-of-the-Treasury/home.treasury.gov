In remarks to a group of economists today, Treasury Secretary Snow stated, Two pillars form the foundation of America's greatness and her people's well-being:   national security and economic security.  Today, right now, both pillars are under threat, and it is our fundamental responsibility to do everything in our power to strengthen both.  As a matter of principle, this Administration believes we have an obligation to the American people, a sacred obligation to rebuild the economy while we protect our nation. We must do both - and those who say we must choose one over the other are wrong - that's a false choice.  The President is doing everything in his control to protect our national security.  He is also doing everything in his control to strengthen the economy and create jobs.  Now is not the time for partisan politics.  Now is the time to work together.  We cannot wait until the war is over to focus on economic growth.  We must act now.  Those who are looking for work cannot wait for a job, and should not have to wait for a job.

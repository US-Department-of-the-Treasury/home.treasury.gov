In a ceremony at the Department of the Treasury yesterday , Secretary John Snow signed a statement of support for Treasury employees who serve in the National Guard or Reserves. It is with great respect for the National Guard and Reserves that I sign this Statement of Support, Secretary Snow said. As civil servants, I believe we should all be humbled to work alongside the men and women who are giving twice to their country – first by serving in the Federal Government and second by volunteering for the ultimate in service, the defense of our great nation and all its precious freedoms. I am proud to affix my signature to a document that makes official my heartfelt support, and deep support from the Treasury, of these valiant federal employees.



The statement of support joins Treasury with other employers by pledging the following:


1. Employment will not be denied because of service in the Guard or Reserve;
2. Employee job and career opportunities will not be limited or reduced because of service in the Guard or Reserve;
3. Employees will be granted leaves of absence for military service in the Guard or Reserve, consistent with existing laws, without sacrifice of vacation; and
4. [The] agreement and its resultant policies will be made known throughout the organization.

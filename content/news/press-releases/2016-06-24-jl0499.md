WASHINGTON – The people of the United Kingdom have spoken and we respect their decision.  We will work closely with both London and Brussels and our international partners to ensure continued economic stability, security, and prosperity in Europe and beyond.

We continue to monitor developments in financial markets.  I have been in regular contact in recent weeks with my counterparts and financial market participants in the UK, EU and globally and we are continuing to consult closely.  The UK and other policymakers have the tools necessary to support financial stability, which is key to economic growth.

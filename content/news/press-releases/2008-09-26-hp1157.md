**Washington, DC --** Treasury issued the following statement by Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs and Director of Policy Planning Michele Davis:

Secretary Paulson appreciates the hard work by members on both sides of the aisle to address the threat we face to our economy. Noting difficult credit market conditions, he urged members of both parties to complete legislation quickly. Treasury staff has been working with Congressional committee staff since Saturday. There are still open issues to be resolved, and we are committed to resolving them.

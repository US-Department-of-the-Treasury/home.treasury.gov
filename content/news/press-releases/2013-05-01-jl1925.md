​**** **** **WASHINGTON - **Congressman Watt is a tireless public servant with deep knowledge and vast experience who has earned the respect of leaders on both sides of the aisle.  He has spent his career working on a bipartisan basis to protect consumers and propel economic growth. As the Administration works with Congress to reform the housing finance system, help responsible homeowners refinance their mortgages, and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class, there is no one more qualified than Congressman Watt to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency. I urge the Senate to act quickly to confirm this important nomination.”

Today at 4:00 pm EST, Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill will participate in a United States – Jersey Tax Information Exchange Agreement Signing Ceremony in the Treasury Department's Diplomatic Reception Room.  Secretary O'Neill has made these agreements a priority and has spoken out on numerous occasions about our important obligation to enforce our tax laws, because failing to do so undermines the confidence of honest taxpayers in the fairness of our tax system. Access to needed information is vital to our efforts to ensure enforcement of our laws.  These agreements help us ensure that no haven exists anywhere in the world for the funds associated with illicit activities, including terrorism, money laundering, and tax evasion.

The Small Business Financing Forum marked another step in the Obama Administration's commitment to ensuring small businesses can play a crucial role in leading job growth and recovery. As they search for the best ideas and strategies to bring to the President, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Small Business Administrator Karen Mills will build on the measures the Obama Administration has already taken to help small businesses expand through increased access to credit and new tax cuts as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

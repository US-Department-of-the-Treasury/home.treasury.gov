I know I speak for everyone at the Treasury Department and the Customs Bureau in saying that our thoughts are with the families of the two Customs inspectors who were shot this morning in Calexico, California. We all hope for a speedy recovery of these two brave men.

This is a vivid reminder of the dangerous -- and often thankless -- work that Customs employees do every day in protecting America’s borders. These men and women are literally at the front lines of the effort to keep illegal weapons and drugs out of our country.

Today's report on GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year further demonstrates that a good recovery is underway.  Economic growth in the second half of 2003 was the fastest in nearly 20 years. The President's well-timed Jobs and Growth tax relief plan led to broad-based improvements. Following last year's exceptional third quarter, 2003 ended with solid gains.  We are seeing good economic news on many fronts and we are encouraged, but we are not satisfied. The Administration's efforts will continue until every American looking for work can find a job.

In a statement last Friday on the December employment report, Treasury Secretary John Snow said: The year 2005 was a very good one indeed for the 2 million Americans who found new jobs. Today's employment report is the latest indication that the American economy is firing on all cylinders. Before the hurricanes that hit us so hard this fall, the U.S. economy was generating about 200,000 jobs per month. After two months affected by the weather – September and October – it appears we have regained that pace, creating over 400,000 jobs in the past two months. I also note that we have enjoyed 31 straight months of job growth and, during that time, have added more than 4.6 million jobs. As we begin 2006, we have every reason to be optimistic that this economy – the most flexible, resilient and robust in the world – will continue to grow and create good jobs.

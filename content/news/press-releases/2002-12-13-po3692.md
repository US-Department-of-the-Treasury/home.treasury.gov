The Treasury Department today announced that Michele Davis, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs, will leave government service at the end of the year.

Davis plans to join Fannie Mae, as Vice President for Regulatory Policy.

“Michele has done an outstanding job communicating President Bush's efforts to keep America's economy strong and to spread prosperity around the world,” said Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill.

Davis played an essential role at the Treasury Department over the last two years.  She led the Department's efforts to inform the nation of the benefits of President Bush's tax relief program, the state of the government's finances, the need for better results from international development assistance and the Secretary's understanding of the American economy.  Davis’ tenure at Treasury included tumultuous times for the nation, and she worked to ensure that the Treasury’s actions in the wake of September 11 were well understood – from implementation of the PATRIOT act to improvements in border security to the opening of the financial front in the war on terrorism.

“Michele brought invaluable experience to her position and with that background and perspective, she played an important role in shaping many of the public policy debates within the Administration and on Capitol Hill,” O’Neill concluded.

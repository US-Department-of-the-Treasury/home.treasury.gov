JS-205
As the President has said, we are committed to a jobs and growth package of at least $550 billion in tax relief that includes all of the elements the President has proposed, including 100% exclusion of the double tax on dividends and all the tax rate reductions already approved by Congress in 2001 - relief which will immediately help millions of  Americans and especially small businessmen and women.   There are many ways to achieve the President's priorities, and we will work with Congress in the weeks ahead to determine the best way to achieve those priorities.

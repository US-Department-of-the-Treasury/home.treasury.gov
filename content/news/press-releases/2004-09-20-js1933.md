Treasury Secretary John Snow and Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson will be in Manchester, New Hampshire on Tuesday, September 21 to discuss the Bush Administration's efforts to make health care more accessible and affordable, as well as the impact of health insurance costs on the economy. They will meet with members of the business and medical communities in a townhall meeting format.

The rising cost of health insurance is bad for the small-business community, and it impedes growth in the overall American economy, said Secretary Snow. Health Savings Accounts were created as part of the President's Medicare reform legislation, and they are a terrific new option for the small business community.President Bush believes all Americans should have access to affordable, high-quality health care and I look forward to joining Secretary Thompson in New Hampshire to discuss the President's health care agenda.

 

One of the President's fundamental goals is to reduce frivolous lawsuits while ensuring that injured patients receive swift, certain and fair compensation for their injuries, said Secretary Thompson. Excessive litigation and jury awards have led to increased premiums and higher health care costs for all and have made it more difficult for patients to get care.

While we are disappointed that the Supreme Court did not grant certiorari, it is important to remember, as Justice Ginsburg emphasized in her dissent, that the Court's ruling does not in any sense constitute a ruling on the merits of the issue presented. Even the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed that ensuring the physical safety of the President is a public good of the utmost importance. 

As the Court of Appeals suggested, we look forward to working with Congress on legislation next year regarding the protective function privilege.

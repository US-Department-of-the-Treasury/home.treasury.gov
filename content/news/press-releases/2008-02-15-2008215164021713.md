To build on the discussions that Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. has had with members of Congress in both parties, Treasury is releasing a series of issue briefs that discuss Social Security reform, focusing on the nature of the problem and those aspects of reform that have broad support. By focusing first on areas of agreement, I hope these issue briefs will narrow the divide and spur further discussions of reform, said Secretary Paulson. To date, three issue briefs have been released.

On the anniversary of President Bush's signing of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, the Treasury Department today released two papers analyzing the benefit to American families and businesses from the tax relief enacted over the last seven years. Included in the papers are discussions of how the President's tax relief has made the tax code more progressive, how the marriage penalty has been reduced for millions of couples and the tax increases faced by millions of Americans should the President's tax relief expire.

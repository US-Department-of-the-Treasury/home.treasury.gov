****Senator Connie Mack, Chairman of the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, announced at the Panel's first meeting, February 16, 2005 that the Panel is seeking public comments on the following issues:


1. Headaches, unnecessary complexity, and burdens that taxpayers - both individuals and businesses - face because of the existing system.
2. Aspects of the tax system that are unfair.
3. Specific examples of how the tax code distorts important business or personal decisions.
4. Goals that the Panel should try to achieve as it evaluates the existing tax system and recommends options for reform.


At this point, the Panel is not asking for specific proposals.

Today Secretary O'Neill travels in the Ukraine, where he expressed hope and US support for continued economic development in Central Asia. He said We hold a mutual interest in international security, including the war on terrorism and the fight against weapons of mass destruction. And true security depends on more than military might, intelligence, and arms control - it depends on a shared stake in the future of the global economy, ties of trade, investment, and enterprise. It depends on common values of political and economic freedom, even as we respect diverse cultures and appreciate historical traditions.

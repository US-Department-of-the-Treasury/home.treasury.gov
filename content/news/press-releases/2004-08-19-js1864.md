U.S. Treasury Under Secretary International Affairs John Taylor will visit Tampa, Florida on Friday, August 20 to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs.

Recent indicators show that President Bush's economic policies continue to move the economy forward.  According to the Labor Department, Florida has created nearly 82,000 jobs since the beginning of this year, including nearly 12,000 in June. Florida's unemployment rate, at 4.7 percent, is lower than the national unemployment rate.

 

The national unemployment rate declined to 5.5 percent in July – down 0.8 percentage points from a peak of 6.3 percent in June 2003 and the lowest rate since October 2001.  At 5.5 percent, the unemployment rate is below the average of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  Employment over the last year was up in 46 of the 50 states and the unemployment rate was down in all regions and in 47 of the 50 states.

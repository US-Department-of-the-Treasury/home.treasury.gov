U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will visit Springfield, Missouri on Thursday, August 19 and Des Moines, Iowa on Friday, August 20 to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. As a result of the President's economic leadership, we have overcome a recession and seen 11 straight months of job creation, totaling nearly 1.5 million new U.S. jobs since August 2003, said Secretary Snow.

**WASHINGTON, DC**- The Department of the Treasury and IRS encourage taxpayers to file their taxes by July 15, or file for an automatic extension of time to file to October 15.

Due to COVID-19, the original tax filing and payment deadline for 2019 was postponed from April 15 to July 15.

“We are pleased that over 130 million taxpayers have filed returns and over 93 million refunds have been issued.  After consulting with various external stakeholders, we have decided to have taxpayers request an extension if more time is needed,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.  “I would encourage Americans to file their taxes as soon as possible, so those who are due refunds can receive them quickly.”

“The IRS understands that those affected by the coronavirus may not be able to pay their balances in full by July 15, but we have many payment options to help taxpayers,” said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig.  “These easy-to-use payment options are available on IRS.gov, and most can be done automatically without reaching out to an IRS representative.”

Taxpayers facing economic hardships, including those affected by COVID-19, are encouraged to take advantage of the tools and resources available on IRS.gov.

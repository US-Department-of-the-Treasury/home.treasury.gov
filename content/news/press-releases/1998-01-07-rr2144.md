It is with great sadness that the Treasury Department announces the death of Customs Senior Special Agent Manuel Zurita. Agent Zurita died last night of massive injuries suffered on January 1, 1998, while assisting the U.S. Secret Service on a Presidential protection detail.

Agent Zurita, a 12-year veteran of the U.S. Customs Service, was one of three Customs Special Agents seriously injured when their vessel collided with a reef in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

I am greatly saddened by this tragic loss. My deepest condolences go out to Agent Zurita's wife and their four children.

This tragedy underscores the dangerous and difficult work performed by our law enforcement bureaus every day. We owe them a debt of gratitude for keeping our country safe.

The U.S. Customs Service is currently investigating the accident.

This week, Deputy Treasury Secretary Ken Dam provided a progress report on implementation of the USA PATRIOT ACT to the House Committee on Financial Services, Chaired by Michael Oxley (R-OH). Dam leads a high level inter-agency group tasked with exposing, isolating and incapacitating the financial infrastructure of terrorist organizations. The USA PATRIOT ACT, signed into law by President Bush in October 2001, contained new tools to enhance our ability to combat the financing of terrorism and money laundering.

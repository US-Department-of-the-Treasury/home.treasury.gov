WASHINGON, DC -- The net long position reporting requirement in Treasury auctions requires auction participants to report their net long position as described in Treasury's Uniform Offering Circular (31CFR Part 356).

For auction participants that have difficulty calculating their net long positions as a result of the tragedy on September 11, Treasury will accept best faith estimates of net long positions in the 13-week bill and 26-week bill auctions on Monday.

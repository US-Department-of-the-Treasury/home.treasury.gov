**Washington, D.C.--** The Treasury Department today announced that on June 7, 2007 the United States delivered to the Government of Sweden a notice of termination of the tax treaty between the two countries with respect to estates, inheritances, and gifts.

In accordance with the provisions of the treaty, the notice of termination provides that the treaty will cease to have effect as of January 1, 2008.  At the time the treaty was signed, Sweden maintained a tax on inheritances and gifts.  Sweden has since abolished this tax such that the treaty is no longer needed to prevent double taxation with respect to taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts.

Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement today on the Senate’s confirmation of Charles “Chuck” Rettig as Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS):
“I applaud the Senate for voting to confirm Chuck Rettig, an extremely adept tax lawyer and devoted taxpayer advocate. I look forward to Chuck’s leadership and experience, which will improve taxpayer service, protect hardworking taxpayers, and ensure the proper, impartial, and efficient implementation of the U.S. Tax Code.
“I want to thank David Kautter, who has served as Acting IRS Commissioner for the past 11 months during a pivotal time as we work to administer the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We welcome David back to his role as Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy where he will continue to work with IRS and Treasury on implementing tax reform.”

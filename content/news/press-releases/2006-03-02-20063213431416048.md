**Los Altos ,  Calif.  –** In a visit to the Cisco Networking Academy at Foothill College yesterday, Treasury Secretary John Snow discussed the importance of relevant worker training to the American economy: As Treasury secretary, I'm interested in keeping the American economy strong and thriving, and education and worker training is a critical component to sustaining our economic strength. The outstanding American workforce drives our economy, but workers need the skills to compete. Job training is therefore essential, but it is meaningless unless it is for jobs that actually exist. That means the priority must be on job-training programs that are flexible, work with employers, and meet the demands of the local workplace and global economy. That's happening here at the Cisco Networking Academy and it's inspiring to see.

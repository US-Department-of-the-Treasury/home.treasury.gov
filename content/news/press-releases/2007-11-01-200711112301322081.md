Secretary Paulson and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson met Wednesday with the HOPE Now alliance to discuss ways to help more struggling homeowners. HOPE Now members discussed a new letter campaign, which is expected to increase the number of homeowners who reach out for the group's help. Paulson also called upon industry participants to adopt specific criteria to quickly identify borrowers who can keep their homes and to follow up with a refinancing, a loan modification or other flexibility.

In a speech Thursday morning to the employees of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Treasury Secretary John Snow discussed the critical role that Treasury plays in protectingAmerica's national security. After 9/11 we knew that our top priority was fighting the war on terror to keepAmericasafe, Snow said.  For Treasury, that meant a critical new role – leading the effort to disrupt terrorist finance and deny terrorists the funds they need to carry on their activities.  In pursuing this new mission, we are using the tools and lessons-learned in our efforts over many years to combat money laundering, narcotics trafficking and other rogue threats to our financial system.

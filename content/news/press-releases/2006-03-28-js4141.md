Today's news that consumer confidence in theU.S. economy is at the highest level in almost four years is very good to see, and it bodes well for good, strong job creation in the coming months.



This level of confidence reflects the buoyancy that job creation and wage gains are giving to the American people. With lower taxes on income and investment having led to strong growth and improved standards of living, there can be no doubt that the economy is heading in the right direction, and so it is not surprising to see consumer confidence at this level.



With so much evidence that the President's economic policies are working, now would be the wrong time to stray from those policies. Lower tax rates, especially on investment, lie at the heart of this strong expansion. The record is clear; now Congress needs to act to extend the tax relief and make it permanent.

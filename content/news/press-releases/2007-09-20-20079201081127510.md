Secretary Paulson joins HUD Secretary Jackson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke today to testify before Congress on efforts to minimize mortgage foreclosures. We are working very hard to try to help as many Americans as possible keep their homes, said Paulson. The earlier we identify struggling borrowers, the more likely they will be able to modify their mortgage or refinance into a more affordable mortgage. The most crucial message we can send is to borrowers who are missing, or are concerned that they will miss, their mortgage payments: call your lender or a mortgage counselor today.

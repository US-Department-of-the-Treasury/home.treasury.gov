WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) released detailed results of auctions held from June 3 to 13, 2024, to sell its warrants for the purchase of common stock of the 11 publicly traded airlines listed below. Treasury [announced](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2422) on June 21, 2024 that it received $556,685,001 in aggregate proceeds from the auctions. Detailed results of the 11 auctions are provided below.

Treasury received these warrants in connection with financial assistance and loans Treasury provided to U.S. airlines and certain other types of businesses in 2020 and 2021 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021; and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

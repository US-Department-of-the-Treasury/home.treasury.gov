Treasury did not proceed with the sale of its Series B preferred stock in First Community Financial and its Series A preferred stock in First Western Financial,Inc.and sold approximately 67% of its Series C preferred stock in First Western Financial, Inc., due to the fact that Treasury did not receive sufficient bids above the respective minimum prices for each security in accordance with the auction procedures.  Treasury set a minimum price for each security as part of the auctions in ordertoprotect taxpayer interests.The aggregate gross proceeds to Treasury from the auctions are expected to be approximately $248.5 million. This is the first auction Treasury is conducting that includes CPP Securities of institutions with no publicly traded common equity.

 

TARP’s bank programs have already earned a significant profit for taxpayers. Including the expected proceeds from the transactions announced today, Treasury has now recovered $265 billion from TARP’s bank programs through repayments, dividends, interest, and other income – compared to the $245 billion initially invested. Each additional dollar recovered from TARP’s bank programs is an additional dollar of profit for taxpayers.

These auctions are part of the strategy that Treasury outlined in May for winding down its remaining TARP bank investments in a way that protects taxpayer interests, promotes financial stability, and preserves the strength of our nation’s community banks. Treasury indicated that it intends to use a combination of repayments, restructurings, and sales to manage and recover those remaining investments. As described in the announcement, sales would include auctions of individual investments, as well as potentially combining individual investments together into auction pools.  Beginning in the fall of 2012, Treasury expects to conduct the first in a series of pooled auctions of CPP Securities.

“TARP's bank investment programs were critical to stabilizing an economy in freefall and have already realized a nearly $20 billion positive return for taxpayers,” said Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad. “These auctions are an important part of our efforts to wind down the program in a way that helps support our nation's community banks and recovers additional taxpayer dollars.”

The closings for the auctions are expected to occur on or about August 9 and 10, 2012, subject to customary closing conditions.  The auctions were priced through a modified Dutch auction.

The CPP Securities were offered only to (1) “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Act, (2) certain institutional “accredited investors” as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Act that have total assets of not less than $25,000,000 and (3) in certain cases, certain directors and executive officers of the issuers of the CPP Securities.  The CPP Securities sold in the auctions may not be offered or sold absent registration under, or an applicable exemption from, applicable state securities law.

This news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.

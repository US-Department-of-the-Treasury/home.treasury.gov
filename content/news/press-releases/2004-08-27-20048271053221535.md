Secretary John Snow is in Grand Rapids, Michigan today to meet with local business leaders. He will discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy, including tax cut permanency, tort reform and curbing health insurance costs. The rising cost of health insurance is bad for the small-business community, and it impedes growth in the overall American economy, he said. The President has called upon the Congress repeatedly to pass Association Health Plans, which would allow small-business owners and their employees to join together into larger groups to purchase health insurance.

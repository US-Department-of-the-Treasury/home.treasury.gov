On behalf of the Treasury Department, and in particular the terrific employees of the U.S. Mint, I offer heartfelt congratulations to Henrietta Fore on her confirmation as Under Secretary of State for Management.



Henrietta assumes this prestigious new position after four outstanding years as Director of the U.S. Mint, where she was very successful at implementing the President's vision for effective management and results in government. While at the Mint, she took an interest in each and every job that employees performed to run the United States Mint, as she would say, in mint condition, and that is, indeed, how things ran under her leadership.



I know that Henrietta is looking forward to working closely with Secretary Rice to assure that the men and women of the State Department have the tools they need to pursue the President's foreign policy goals. While she will be missed at the U.S. Mint and by the broader Treasury team, we all wish her luck and know that she will excel in her new position.

JS-121

I applaud the House for quickly passing a budget resolution in support of the President's full jobs and growth plan. This action means we are one step closer to giving the economy the jump start it needs to grow, and one step closer to creating more jobs and restoring confidence--so that everyone who wants a job can find one.I thank our supporters in the House who once again delivered for the President and the American people.

Secretary John W. Snow is in Tampa, Florida today, to visit a job training program at a local high school. Preparing for your career through lots of good education and training is a recipe for a lifetime of employment opportunity, he said. Here in Florida, economic recovery and growth means you will be more likely to find a good job after your graduate. President Bush's tax cuts gave our economy the oxygen it needed to right itself. For example, Florida has generated 99,200 jobs so far this year. The Secretary will be in Orlando, Florida tomorrow.

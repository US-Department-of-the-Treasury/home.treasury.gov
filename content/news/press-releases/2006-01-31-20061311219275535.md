Treasury Secretary John Snow will joined the President's Cabinet on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives for the State of the Union Address. The state of the American economy is strong, with ample opportunities for jobs and entrepreneurship, Secretary Snow said this morning. I'm looking forward to hearing the President discuss the policies that will keep the economy strong for the years and decades ahead.

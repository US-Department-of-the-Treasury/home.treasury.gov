WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Departments of Justice and Treasury announced today the deployment of agents from the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Border Patrol and U.S. Customs at designated airport security check points throughout the country. The heightened security measures are part a broad effort by federal law enforcement authorities to provide a larger police presence at airports as they prepare to reopen and resume regular air travel. 

The Department of Justice along with other federal law enforcement agencies will expend every effort to ensure that air travel in the United States and abroad is safe and orderly, said Attorney General John Ashcroft. The presence of these officers, in addition to the heightened security procedures already put into effect, will serve as a visible reminder of the United States Government's commitment to protecting the safety of American citizens.



In times such as these it is important to use all available resources, said Treasury Under Secretary for Enforcement, Jimmy Gurule. U.S. Customs officers have the training and expertise to help augment the nations airport security system. This is a wise use of a valuable resource. The Treasury agency supports the use of interagency cooperation in forming a unified front against terrorism.

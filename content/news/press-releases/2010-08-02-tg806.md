**Washington, D.C. - -** The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced its current estimates of net marketable borrowing for the July – September 2010 and the October - December 2010 quarters:

- During the July – September 2010 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $350 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $270 billion, which includes $200 billion for the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP).The borrowing estimate is $26 billion lower than announced in May 2010.The decrease in borrowing relates primarily to lower outlays and a higher-than-announced beginning-of-quarter cash balance.
- During the October - December 2010 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $380 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $270 billion, which includes $200 billion for the SFP.

During the April - June 2010 quarter, Treasury issued $344 billion in net marketable debt, and finished the quarter with a cash balance of $290 billion, of which $200 billion was attributable to the SFP.In May, Treasury estimated $340 billion in net marketable borrowing and assumed an end-of-June cash balance of $280 billion, which included an SFP balance of $200 billion.The increase in the cash balance related to higher net cash flows and net marketable borrowing.

Additional financing details relating to Treasury's Quarterly Refunding will be released at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, August 4.

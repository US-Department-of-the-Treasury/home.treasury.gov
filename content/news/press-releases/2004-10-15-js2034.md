JS-2034

We were pleased to learn, today, that retail sales made a 1.5 percent leap in September - more than double the 0.7 percent increase anticipated by financial markets. This indicator is one more sign that our economy is growing stronger and is on the right path for future growth and job creation.The fiscal policies implemented by President Bush, coupled with the actions of the Federal Reserve, have led our country out of difficult economic times into recovery, growth and job creation. I am optimistic that our best economic days are ahead of us.

The forecast we released shows that economic growth is steady, strong, and our economy's underlying fundamentals are robust. All signs indicate that the President's economic policies are working, especially for job-seekers; 3.5 million new jobs have been created over the past two years. There is considerable good economic news to report on, as well as look forward to.

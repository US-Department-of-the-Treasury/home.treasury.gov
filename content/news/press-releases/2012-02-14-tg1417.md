**WASHINGTON** –The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today designated Humayd ‘Abd-al-Salam under Executive Order 13566 for acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of Saadi Qadhafi, a son of former Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, and because he has materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in support of Saadi Qadhafi. OFAC designated Saadi Qadhafi pursuant to Executive Order 13566 on March 11, 2011.The United Nations also imposed sanctions on Saadi Qadhafi on March 17, 2011 in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973.

In late September 2011, during the popular revolt seeking to overthrow the Qadhafi regime, and after the imposition of U.S. and United Nations sanctions against Muammar Qadhafi and his sons, Saadi and Mutassim, Humayd ‘Abd-al-Salam reportedly coordinated a meeting for Saadi Qadhafi. In early October 2011, Humayd ‘Abd-al-Salam reportedly coordinated the delivery of vehicles and drivers to Saadi Qadhafi and Mutassim Qadhafi. Additionally, in early October 2011, Humayd was instructed by the late Mutassim Qadhafi to arrange payment for a shipment of military equipment, including sniper rifles and night vision devices.

“Today’s designation targets a key supporter of Saadi Qadhafi, who remains determined to carry on his father’s legacy, to reverse Libya’s democratic transition through violence, and to foster instability in the region,” said Adam J. Szubin, Director of OFAC. “The United States of America is determined to assist the Libyan people as they work to develop a democratic, peaceful, and prosperous society, and will expose those who are trying to derail Libya’s transition.”

As a result of today’s action, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with Humayd ‘Abd-al-Salam and any assets he may have subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

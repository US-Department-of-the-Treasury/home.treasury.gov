The U.S. Treasury Department released the 2006 budget results this week, confirming that we have exceeded the President's target of cutting the deficit in half while maintaining a strong and growing economy. Speaking Wednesday, the President said: "These budget numbers are proof that pro-growth economic policies work. By restraining spending in Washington, and allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn, we're creating jobs, reducing the deficit and making this nation prosperous for all our citizens

I commend the Senate for moving forward with legislation to provide a federal backstop for terrorism insurance. Such legislation is vitally needed to mitigate the economic drag we are currently experiencing due to the scarcity of terrorism insurance and to minimize adverse economic consequences from possible future attacks.

I am deeply disappointed, however, that the Senate rejected Senator McConnell's amendment to provide for litigation management procedures to protect against abusive litigation and punitive damages claims. Such procedures are crucial to the protection of American taxpayers' interests and needs to be included in any final legislation.

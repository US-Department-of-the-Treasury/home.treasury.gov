We had a useful and productive meeting.

We agreed that stopping the financing of terrorist organizations and enforcement of UN sanctions is an absolutely essential, non-military tool in the battle against global terror.

We agreed that the tools to advance the financial fight on terrorism should be reviewed and improved to sharpen our effectiveness and protect the legal rights of individuals.

**Examples of Terrorism Insurance Difficulties** Prior to January 1st2002, Gwinnett County, GA, in Atlanta’s metropolitan area paid approximately $349,000 for $1.8 billion of property-casualty insurance, including $300 million of terrorism coverage. At renewal, Gwinnett secured only $500 million in property-casualty insurance for the county’s jail, police headquarters, sewage treatment plants, government center, and other municipal buildings from its primary carrier, and only $1 million of terrorism insurance coverage. Additionally, the county’s premiums climbed to $502,000 per year. Gwinnett County then went out and purchased a $50 million terrorism insurance policy from Lloyds of London for $390,000.

After discussions with over 40 different insurance companies for general liability coverage, the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) received quotes from only two companies just days before the Salt Lake City Games were to begin. Both quotes excluded terrorism coverage. The day before the Olympic Winter Games began, the USOC secured a minimal amount of terrorism risk coverage – 5 percent of its expiring general liability limit, for the full price of the broader coverage – a 20-fold increase in cost per dollar of coverage. The USOC is currently negotiating a policy for 3 U.S. Olympic training sites, for an April 16 renewal. So far, it has received 5 quotes for insurance coverage, but none of them includes terrorism coverage.

The LeFrak Organization, owner of a new large office building in Jersey City, New Jersey, experienced difficulty obtaining mortgage financing because of the high cost of terror coverage. Self-insurance was not an option since all of LeFrak’s lenders, including the securitization market, required terrorism insurance. After an extensive search, LeFrak was able to obtain terrorism coverage. But this came at a substantially higher cost – $400,000 for standard property-casualty coverage and another $400,000 for terrorism insurance. Prior to 9/11, the entire cost of the coverage for this building, including terrorism coverage, was $60,000.

Major hotel companies, including such well-known brands as Embassy Suites, Hilton, Holiday Inn, Hyatt, Marriott, Sheraton, Westin and others, have lost or will soon lose within the next 60 days terrorism coverage under their property insurance programs. These companies are finding that whatever replacement terrorism insurance coverage is available is inadequate to meet their insurance needs. These companies employ millions of Americans, including people working in the hotels, building the hotels and all the other indirect jobs that are required to support hotel properties.

The Wisconsin Energy Corporation has been informed by its insurer that coverage will no longer be available for acts of terrorism when its policy comes up for renewal in July.

In a recent insurance renewal, Baylor University was able to get only half the coverage for twice the price, and its terrorism risk coverage was even more limited.

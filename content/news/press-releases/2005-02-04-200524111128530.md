Secretary Snow called January's job growth a sign of economic strength today. With upward revisions, a total of 2.7 million jobs have been created in 20 straight months. At 5.2 percent the unemployment rate remains below the average of the past three decades, he said.

This administration is committed to ensuring the continuing strength of the economy and steady pace of job creation. President Bush has set forth a bold economic agenda for America to strengthen Social Security, reform the tax code, curb abusive lawsuits, and exercise the fiscal discipline necessary to cut the deficit in half in five years. By facing these economic challenges, we will stay on track to continue growing the economy, creating jobs and meeting the needs of America's workers and families. - Secretary Snow

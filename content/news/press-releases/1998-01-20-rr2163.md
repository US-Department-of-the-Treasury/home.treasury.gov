I had a very good meeting today with Finance Minister Tarrin. The Minister underscored Thailand's commitment to a comprehensive program of reform, including steps to strengthen and restructure the financial sector. The United States welcomes the strong efforts of Prime Minister Chuan and his government to address the economic situation in Thailand.

Minister Tarrin and I agreed that the focus of Thailand's efforts should remain on the need to restore confidence through the strong implementation of the policies it has agreed to in the context of the IMF program. I told the Minister that the United States has and will continue to support adequate financing from the international financial institutions for the Thai reform effort.

The United States has a strong interest in seeing Thailand succeed in reestablishing financial stability and growth.

“For eight years, Jim Flaherty served the people of Canada as the country’s finance minister.  He was admired and respected by his fellow citizens and leaders throughout the world.  Known for his drive and hard work, Jim was instrumental in helping Canada navigate the global financial crisis.  He was also a devoted advocate for sound fiscal policy and making sure workers had the chance to retire with dignity.  I send my thoughts and prayers to the people of Canada and Jim’s wife, sons, and the entire Flaherty family.”

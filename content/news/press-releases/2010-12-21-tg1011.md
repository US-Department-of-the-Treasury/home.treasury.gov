**WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today designated Zimbabwe’s Attorney General, Johannes Tomana, pursuant to Executive Order 13469, which targets, among others, senior officials of the Government of Zimbabwe and persons who have engaged in actions or policies to undermine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes or institutions.

Appointed by President Robert Mugabe, Tomana has selectively prosecuted political opponents and their perceived supporters in an effort to undermine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes and institutions. As a result of today’s designation, U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions with Tomana, and any assets he holds under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

“Johannes Tomana’s targeting of selected political opponents threatens the rule of law in Zimbabwe, harms the integrity of the Government of National Unity and counters the will of Zimbabwean people, who have expressed their desire to build a democratic political system,” said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin.

Formerly Zimbabwe’s Deputy Attorney General, Tomana was appointed to the position of Attorney General by President Mugabe in December 2008. His appointment followed the signing of the Global Political Agreement between the Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) and MDC leaders in September 2008. Occurring before the swearing in of the new Government of National Unity in February 2009, Tomana’s appointment was made without consultation with MDC leaders and against the spirit of Zimbabwe’s Global Political Agreement signed on September 15, 2008.​

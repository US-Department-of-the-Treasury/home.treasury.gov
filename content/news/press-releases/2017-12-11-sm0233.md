**Washington** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released a summary analysis from the Office of Tax Policy (OTP) of the expected tax receipts associated with the Administration's economic growth initiatives. Among the key findings is that $1.8 trillion of additional revenue would be generated over 10 years based upon expected growth.



"We are pleased to release an analysis demonstrating the revenue impact of the Administration's economic agenda. The Administration has been focused on tax reform and broader economic policies to stimulate growth, which will generate significant long-term revenue for the government," said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.



The work done by OTP has been critical to Treasury's contributions to The Unified Framework released in September 2017. We appreciate that OTP has been also providing important technical assistance to the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee as tax reform has proceeded.

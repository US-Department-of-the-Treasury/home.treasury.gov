Now that the President signed into law the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have posted the new lower withholding tables on their websites.  The President's signature means more money in workers' paychecks now.  The new withholding tables will tell employers and payroll administrators how much less in federal income taxes to withhold from workers’ wages. By the end of the week, wage bracket method tables are also expected to be on the IRS website. Printed copies of Publication 15-T, containing all the withholding tables, will be mailed to all employers nationwide by the third week in June.

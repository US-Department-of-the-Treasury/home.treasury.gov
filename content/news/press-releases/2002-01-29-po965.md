On June 25 th, 2001, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill launched a web site aimed at increasing the transparency of U.S. actions with respect to ongoing international efforts to improve the stability of financial systems around the globe and to keep criminals from abusing the international financial system. Today, the Treasury Department has taken another important step on the transparency front by posting the United States' recently completed self-evaluation with respect to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Special Recommendations on Terrorist Financing. Also posted on the site is the Federal Reserve's self-evaluation of compliance with core principles that serve as universal guidelines for the design and operation of safe and efficient payment systems worldwide. These guidelines and other internal evaluations can be found at: [http://www.treas.gov/standards/](http://www.treas.gov/standards/).

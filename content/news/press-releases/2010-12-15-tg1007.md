**Secretary Geithner Says Agreement Will “Accelerate the Pace of the Recovery and Help the Private Sector Continue to Create New Jobs”  WASHINGTON** – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released the following statement from Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner regarding the passage by the United States Senate of the Tax Relief,UnemploymentInsurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act of 2010:

“Today’s Senate vote brings us another step closer to putting in place an agreement that will accelerate the pace of the recovery and help the private sector continue to create new jobs for American workers.  This bill will provide substantial benefits to our economy by ensuring middle class Americans won’t see their taxes increase on January 1, establishing a new payroll tax cut, continuing unemployment insurance benefits for Americans looking for work, and providing tax relief to working families raising children, students paying for college and businesses that make new investments.

“The President has been clear from the beginning that there are provisions in this bill he does not support.  But they were necessary compromises in order to secure the President’s top priorities – initiatives targeted to strengthen growth, create jobs, and help working and middle class families.

“As we approach the January 1 deadline for protecting tens of millions of middle class Americans from a substantial tax increase, and with millions of Americans seeking work set to lose their unemployment insurance benefits, I strongly urge members of both parties in the House to vote in favor of this legislation and move quickly to send a bill to President Obama’s desk for his signature.” ​

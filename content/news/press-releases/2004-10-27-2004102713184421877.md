Treasury Secretary John W. Snow is in Cedar Rapids, Iowa today to meet with local business leaders to discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs. The President's tax relief is still working for the people of Iowa, with more than one million taxpayers saving money on their income tax bills in 2004 and more than 280,000 business taxpayers like you able to use your 2004 tax savings to invest in business equipment and employee compensation, he said.

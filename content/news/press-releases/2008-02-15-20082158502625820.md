Under Secretary for International Affairs David H. McCormick spoke today on open investment and America's prosperity at the Tuck Global Capital Markets Conference. Lower trade and investment barriers benefit not only the United States, but also the global economy as a whole. The depth, liquidity and efficiency of our capital markets should continue to make the United States the most attractive country in the world in which to invest, said McCormick.

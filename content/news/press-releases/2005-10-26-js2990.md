U.S. Treasury Department, Washington, DC

Assalamualaikum and warm Ramadan greetings. I am honored to host you tonight at the Treasury Department for this special meal, and to join you in recognition of the holy month of Ramadan.

I sincerely appreciate the chance to meet and have a meal together, and the chance to talk with you about the good that comes from this month of prayer and togetherness. Secretary Snow and I stand in admiration of your faith, and of the significance of the fasting and personal sacrifice of Ramadan. This is a time to give thanks for God's blessings through works of charity, which is of the highest purpose.

I know it deeply saddens all of us to realize that there are some who commit atrocities in the name of this great faith, and that Muslim charities have been abused in the process. At Treasury, we are proud to work closely with you to blunt the effects of those who would use the Muslim faith for ill purposes. Tonight, however, is a time for celebrating your faith, and I am grateful to have had this chance to gather in fellowship and honor the many good deeds and generosity of the Muslim people. Ramadan Mubarak.

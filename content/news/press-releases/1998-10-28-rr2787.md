We welcome Brazil's announcement of a strong fiscal adjustment program to strengthen Brazil's public finances. It is essential that Brazil implement their program promptly and convincingly.

Confidence and stability in Brazil is very important to American economic interests and to the economy of the hemisphere and the world. We look forward to working with the international community to support Brazil's economic program.

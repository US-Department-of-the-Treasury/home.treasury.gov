Secretary John W. Snow this weekend held a press conference following the conclusion of Washington, DC meetings of the finance ministers and Central Bank governors of the G-7 countries. The economic outlook continues to be favorable for 2005, despite the unwelcome news of oil prices, and we all agreed that improving growth must be our top priority, he said.

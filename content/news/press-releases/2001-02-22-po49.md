Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill made the following statement regarding the decision of the Turkish government to float the Turkish lira:

We fully support the government of Turkey's actions today to float the Turkish lira.

Over the last year, Turkey's economic reform program, supported by the IMF, has successfully achieved many of its important goals on both the macroeconomic and structural fronts. We believe that today's actions, coupled with firm and determined implementation of appropriate supportive policies, can be successful in preserving the gains from the program so far and strengthening the foundation for sustained growth and disinflation in Turkey.

Turkey is an important ally and good friend of the United States. The United States continues to back the IMF's ongoing support for Turkey's economic reform program.

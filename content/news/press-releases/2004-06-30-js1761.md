U.S. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow will visit Portland, Maine on Thursday, July 8 and Manchester, New Hampshire on Friday, July 9 to meet with local business leaders and discuss the President's efforts to strengthen the economy and create jobs.

As a result of the President's tax reform and economic policies, 1.4 million new U.S. jobs have been created since August 2003, including 1.2 million that were created this year, said Secretary Snow.  Last month, Maine gained 2,100 new jobs and New Hampshire gained 4,600.

The President's tax reform policies have ensured that 490,000 Maine taxpayers and more than 525,000 New Hampshire taxpayers will have lower income tax bills in 2004.

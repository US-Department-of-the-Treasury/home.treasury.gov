**Washington **– Through the first four weeks, the IRS and taxpayers are experiencing a strong tax filing season with refunds reaching taxpayers as planned.

“Nearly 50 million taxpayers have filed tax returns and have received over $117 billion of their money back in tax refunds,” said Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.  “Taxpayers are seeing an average of $3,125 per refund, a significant return for hardworking Americans across the country.”

The number of returns filed and the average refund are substantially similar to IRS statistics from the first four weeks of the 2019 filing season.  The data released today includes refunds due to Earned Income Tax Credits and Child Tax Credits, which were held until February 15 due to the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act.

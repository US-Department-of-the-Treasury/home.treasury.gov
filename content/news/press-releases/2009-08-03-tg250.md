**Washington, D.C. -- The U.S. Department of the Treasury**today announced its current estimates of marketable borrowing for the July – September 2009 and the October – December 2009 quarters:

- During the July – September 2009 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $406 billion of marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $270 billion, which includes $200 billion for the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP).The borrowing estimate is $109 billion lower than announced in April 2009.The decrease in borrowing is primarily related to cash balance adjustments and lower outlays associated with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) and the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA).**
- During the October – December quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $486 billion of marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $270 billion, which includes $200 billion for the SFP.

During the April – June 2009 quarter, Treasury borrowed $343 billion of marketable debt, finishing the quarter with a cash balance of $318 billion, of which $200 billion was attributable to the SFP.In April, Treasury had estimated $361 billion in marketable borrowing for the April – June quarter, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $245 billion.The decrease in borrowing and increase in the cash balance was a result of lower net outlays, primarily due to higher repayments of the Treasury's investments under the Capital Purchase Program (EESA) and lower Treasury purchases of GSE preferred stock (HERA).

Additional financing details relating to Treasury's Quarterly Refunding will be released at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, August 5.

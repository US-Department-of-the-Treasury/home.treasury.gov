The Treasury Department today designated three individuals for their role in Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), a terrorist group in Southeast Asia with links to al Qaida. JI, as a terrorist franchise of al Qaida, has demonstrated its wanton desire to kill innocent civilians of every race, religion and creed and continues to pose a real threat to security in Southeast Asia, said Juan Zarate, Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes.

Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. joined Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Leader John Boehner today to announce a bipartisan agreement on an economic growth package. This agreement includes short-term incentives to bolster business investment and consumer spending to keep our economy growing and creating jobs this year. Our economy is fundamentally strong, but the housing correction, credit market turmoil and high oil prices are weighing on growth this year. By passing this economic growth agreement quickly, we can protect the strength of our economy as we weather the housing correction.

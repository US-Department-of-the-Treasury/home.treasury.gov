Friday, the first round of child tax credit advance payment checks will hit the mail. The checks are being sent out as a result of President Bush's Jobs and Growth Act which accelerates the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000 per child effective in 2003 and 2004. This year, a typical family with one child will receive a check for $400. A typical family with two children will receive a check for $800.   In all, approximately 25 million families will receive checks totaling $14 billion.

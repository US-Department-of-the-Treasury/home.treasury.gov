WASHINGTON, DC – Daniel Glaser, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, leads a Treasury delegation to Beijing, China Saturday to offer assistance to the Macanese and Chinese in addressing the issue of North Korean-related funds frozen at Banco Delta Asia (BDA).

The policy and diplomatic issues have been solved – this is now down to implementation. The Macanese and Chinese have made clear that they want to ensure implementation of the agreement is consistent with their own laws and with their international obligations. We are bringing Treasury expertise to help the Macanese and Chinese wade through some of these implementation issues, said Glaser.

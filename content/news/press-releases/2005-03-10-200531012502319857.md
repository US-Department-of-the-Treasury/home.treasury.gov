Secretary John W. Snow is in Albuquerque, New Mexico today to meet with local business leaders at the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce. His remarks Secretary John W. Snow is in Albuquerque, New Mexico today to meet with local business leaders at the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce. His remarks highlighted the President's efforts to strengthen and preserve Social Security. Social Security reform that doesn't raise payroll tax rates, that protects benefits for today's seniors, and that improves the system dramatically for our children and grandchildren can be achieved. The President's courageous leadership has inspired a national discussion and, I'm confident, will lead to historic good results.

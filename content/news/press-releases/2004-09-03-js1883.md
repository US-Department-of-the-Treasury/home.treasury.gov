Today's report is consistent with continued economic expansion. For twelve consecutive months American payrolls have added jobs. The 144,000 added in August, combined with upward revisions for June and July, brings the total to 1.7 million new jobs since this time last year. Over the past twelve months we've seen homeownership in America reach fresh record highs. We've seen improvement in the hard hit manufacturing industry with the addition of more than 100,000 jobs since February. We've seen unemployment fall in all but one of the 50 states.

While these signs are promising, there is more to do and this Administration is committed to the pro-growth policies that will keep our economy moving forward. The bold economic agenda outlined by President Bush last night will continue to drive this economy forward.

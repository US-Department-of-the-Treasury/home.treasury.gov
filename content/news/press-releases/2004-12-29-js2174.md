JS-2174

Today the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service issued guidance on the procedure for making an election to determine corporate tax on income from certain international shipping activities under the new tonnage tax regime.

The tonnage tax regime enacted by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 allows a corporation that is a qualifying vessel operator to elect to be subject to tax on notional income from qualifying shipping activities rather than on actual income from such activities.  An election is effective only if it is made by a corporation that satisfies the specified requirements for eligibility to make the election.  The election is available for taxable years beginning after October 22, 2004, and is effective for the taxable year for which it is made and for all succeeding taxable years until terminated.

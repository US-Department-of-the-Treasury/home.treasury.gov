**At the EcoPartnerships Signing During the U.S. – China Strategic Economic Dialogue Beijing – Today we mark the beginning of what I believe will be a very powerful model for identifying, developing and implementing energy and environmental innovations that will benefit both the American and Chinese people.**Today we mark the beginning of what I believe will be a very powerful model for identifying, developing and implementing energy and environmental innovations that will benefit both the American and Chinese people.

We are here to witness the signing of 7 EcoPartnerships – voluntary, cooperative partnerships between U.S. and Chinese entities including local, state or provincial government-to-government partnerships, and partnerships among businesses, universities and non-profits. By partnering at the sub-national level, ideas can be tested in targeted areas before broad introduction as a new model for sustainable growth, based on energy and environmental innovations.

The signing of the Framework and these EconPartnerships mark new progress in the U.S. –China energy and environment cooperation. With partnerships focused on electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, sustainable economic revitalization in rural areas, cleaner and more energy efficient ports, and other areas, we are together tackling the critical energy and environment challenges facing our two countries.

These voluntary EcoPartnerships will deepen and broaden the ties between the people of our two nations, as we together make progress toward shared goals of energy security and environmental sustainability. I look forward to significant progress through these and other efforts, and congratulate the participants here today for their innovation and dedication to these efforts.

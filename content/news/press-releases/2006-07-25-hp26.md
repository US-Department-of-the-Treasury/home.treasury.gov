U.S. Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for Financial Education Dan Iannicola, Jr. will give remarks on increasing homeownership tomorrow at a roundtable discussion hosted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  This is the first of a series of meetings highlighting successful partnerships which encourage financial education to advance homeownership, as described in the Financial Literacy and Education Commission's national strategy.

The Treasury Department and twenty other agencies and departments in the Financial Literacy and Education Commission released a strategy to improve financial literacy in America earlier this year.  The plan, titled Taking Ownership of the Future: The National Strategy for Financial Literacy, is available in English and Spanish at MyMoney.gov.

**Washington, DC**--Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. today issued the following statement on the departure announcement of International Monetary Fund Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato:



Rodrigo de Rato brought vision and dedication to his tenure as Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund. He launched the Medium Term Strategy, a plan that provides a foundation for important reforms to ensure the institution reflects today's global economy. Rodrigo helped to strengthen the Fund by creating this road map for reform, which will enable the Fund to remain a strong, relevant institution and resource for the global financial system. His leadership was also instrumental in the Fund's revision of its exchange rate surveillance framework, which is a highly critical piece of the road map. I wish him continued success in his future endeavors.

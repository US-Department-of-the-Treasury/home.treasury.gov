Treasury Secretary John Snow and Commerce Secretary Don Evans made the following statement today after the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation to extend the Internet Tax moratorium. Earlier this year, Secretary Snow and Secretary Evans sent a letter to Congress urging them to act quickly to extend the Internet Tax moratorium.



The Internet is an innovative force that opens vast potential economic and social benefits of e-commence and enables such applications as distance learning, telemedicine,e-business, e-government and precision farming. Government must not slow the rollout of Internet services by creating administrative barriers or imposing new access taxes.  Nor should government stifle e-commerce through multiple or discriminatory taxes.



Today's Committee vote is welcome news and will help ensure that the full Congress will have time to pass, and the President to sign, legislation extending the moratorium before it expires on November 1, 2003.

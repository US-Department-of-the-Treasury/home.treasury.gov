I want to reaffirm the continued commitment of the United States to cut ISIL off from economic resources and the international financial system, and to work with the international community.



…



After the September 11th attacks, the United States and our international partners vowed to counter terrorism with every tool we had…  Since that time, we have greatly strengthened the transparency and resilience of the international financial system and developed tools to track and disrupt terror funding streams.



…



ISIL's financing has evolved from seizing territory and looting bank vaults to leveraging more renewable revenue streams…the U.S. approach has evolved as well to attack these vulnerabilities; ISIL's newer financing methods are now targets.



…



While we are making progress to financially isolate ISIL, if we are to succeed we all must intensify our efforts, on our own and together at the international level.



…



Today, we adopted a new UN Security Council resolution that builds on previous measures and strengthens our existing tools…This Resolution is a critical step, but the real test will be determined actions we each take after adoption…As we have all learned—with our work to counter Al-Qaida, ISIL, and other groups to date— successful use of these counter-terror financing tools requires robust domestic implementation, deep collaboration with private partners, and intense multilateral coordination and information sharing.



…



The new Al-Qaida and ISIL Sanctions Regime, and robust implementation of it and other counter-terror financing measures, will help us meet the terror threat, whether from ISIL; others like Al-Qaida, Al-Shabab, Boko Haram, Hizballah, and Nusrah; or new individuals and groups.

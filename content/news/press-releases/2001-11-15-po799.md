Turkey is a close friend and ally of the United States. Turkey's implementation of its reform policies has been very strong. We are pleased that the IMF is recommending completion of Turkey's review and support the other recommendations presented to the Board today. Combined with Turkey's commitment to continue to implement reform measures, these steps should help to reestablish the basis for economic growth.

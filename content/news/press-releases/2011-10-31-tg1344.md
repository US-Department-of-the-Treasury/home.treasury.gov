**WASHINGTON** – The findings from an annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2010 were released today and posted on the Treasury web site at [link](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx).
 
The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
 
A complementary survey measuring foreign holdings of U.S. securities also is conducted annually.  Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held on June 30, 2011, are currently being processed. Preliminary results are expected to be reported on February 29, 2012.
 
Overall Results
 
This survey measured the value of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2010 of approximately $6.8 trillion, with $4.6 trillion held in foreign equity, $1.7 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.  The previous such survey, conducted as of year-end 2009, measured U.S. holdings of approximately $6.0 trillion, with $4.0 trillion held in foreign equity, $1.6 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities. The increase in the value of U.S. portfolio holdings between the two surveys primarily reflects valuation changes in foreign equity during 2010.
 
U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities by country at the end of 2010 were the largest for the United Kingdom ($1,001 billion), followed by Canada ($695 billion), and Japan ($519 billion) (see Table 2). These three countries attracted about one-third of the total U.S. portfolio investment. 
 
The surveys are part of an internationally-coordinated effort under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to improve the measurement of portfolio asset holdings.

[[1]](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/tg1344#_ftnref1)   The stock of foreign securities for December 31, 2010, reported in this survey may not, for a number of reasons, correspond to the stock of foreign securities on December 31, 2009, plus cumulative flows reported in Treasury's transactions reporting system.  An analysis of the relationship between the stock and flow data is available in Table 4 and the associated text of the Report on U.S. Portfolio Holdings of Foreign Securities at end-year 2010.​

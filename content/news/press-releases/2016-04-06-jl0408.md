​**WASHINGTON** - “The Department of Labor’s final conflict of interest rule is an important step toward ensuring that Americans who invest their hard-earned retirement savings receive advice that is in their best interests.  Saving for retirement has changed dramatically since the Department of Labor issued the first fiduciary rule more than 40 years ago, and today individuals are increasingly responsible for their own investment decisions.  Now more than ever, American families need investment advice that aligns with their interests.  The Department of Labor’s work on this rule and engagement with stakeholders will help put the promise of a secure retirement within the reach of more Americans.”   ###

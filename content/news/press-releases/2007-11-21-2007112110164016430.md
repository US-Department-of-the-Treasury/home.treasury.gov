The HOPE NOW Alliance began a new direct mail campaign this week to better help homeowners who could face foreclosure. The alliance, formed after the Secretary Paulson and HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson facilitated discussions between mortgage industry participants and counselors, will send 300,000 letters this month alone to struggling homeowners, with more to come in the following months. The letters will provide helpful information on where to turn to get help refinancing or modifying a mortgage.

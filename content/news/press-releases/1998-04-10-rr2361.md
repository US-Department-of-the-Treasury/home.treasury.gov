I welcome the agreement between the Government of Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund on a revised Letter of Intent. The key to its success is the Indonesian Government's implementation now and over the long term. This agreement supports a comprehensive program designed to restore financial stability and growth in Indonesia.



The United States and the international community have a major stake in seeing Indonesia succeed in its efforts.

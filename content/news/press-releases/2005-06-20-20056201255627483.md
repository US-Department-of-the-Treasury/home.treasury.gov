Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) Stuart Levey announced on Friday the designation of a financial supporter of the Iraqi insurgency. Muhammad Yunis Ahmad was a party to the violence and oppression of the former Hussein regime, said Levey. He still seeks to sabotage the hopes of the Iraqi people by supporting the insurgents' brutal attacks against coalition forces and Iraqis alike.  Designations like today's help cut off the money supporting those efforts.  Ahmad was designated pursuant to Executive Order 13315, which is aimed at blocking property of the former Iraqi regime, its senior officials and their family members and those who act for or on their behalf.  According to information available to the U.S. Government, Ahmad is currently a financial facilitator and operational leader of the New Regional Command of the reconstituted Ba'ath Party. He is instrumental in providing guidance, financial support and coordination of insurgent attacks throughout Iraq.

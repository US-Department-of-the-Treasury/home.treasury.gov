This year, a typical family with one child will receive a check for $400.  A typical family with two children will receive a check for $800.

Eligible taxpayers would receive an average tax cut of $623 each year as a result of the increase in the child tax credit.

For 2003, the increased amount of the child tax credit will be paid in advance to taxpayers who claimed a child tax credit on their 2002 tax return.

o Approximately 25 million families will receive checks totaling $14 billion.o Advance payment checks will be sent out beginning in mid-July over a period of three weeks.

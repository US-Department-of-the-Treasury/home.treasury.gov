**Washington**- The U.S. Treasury Department announced details this week of a $14.77 billion investment in 43 banks made through its Capital Purchase Program.

Treasury created the Capital Purchase Program, a part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, to help to stabilize and strengthen the U.S. financial system. Treasury allocated $250 billion under TARP's Capital Purchase Program to invest in U.S. financial institutions. To date, the Department has made $192 billion of investments, receiving preferred stock and warrants from participating institutions. Investments have ranged from as small as $1 million to as large as $25 billion, financing community banking and Community Development Financial Institutions in 42 states and Puerto Rico.

Institutions that sell shares to the government must comply with[restrictions on executive compensation](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/hp1208)during the period that Treasury holds equity issued through this program and agree to limitations on dividends and stock repurchases. Information about Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program can be found at[http://www.treas.gov/initiatives/eesa/](http://www.financialstability.gov/).

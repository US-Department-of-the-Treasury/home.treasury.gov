**WASHINGTON** – U.S. Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary Mitchell Silk and Vice Minister of Finance Tran Xuan Ha of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam signed the Cooperation Framework to Strengthen Infrastructure Finance on Wednesday, November 6, 2019 in Hanoi.

This cooperative initiative is designed to achieve the mutual goals of the United States and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam to support infrastructure development through market-oriented, private sector investment.

Under this cooperative framework, the United States and the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam will address regulatory, market, and legal barriers to private sector investment by focusing on the development of financial instruments, project finance, the local debt market, capital markets and analysis of contingent government liabilities.

“This important work supports economic growth and our shared goals to meet infrastructure needs through market-oriented, private sector investment,” said U.S. Treasury Acting Assistant Secretary Mitchell Silk.

The engagement supports the broader U.S. Government Indo-Pacific Strategy by complementing ongoing efforts under the Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy (Asia EDGE) and the Infrastructure Transaction and Assistance Network (ITAN).

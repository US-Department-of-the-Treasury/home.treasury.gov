Today Secretary O'Neill testified before the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, where he gave his wholehearted support for transforming our government in order to fight terrorism more effectively and protect our nation. He went on to say We cannot respond to the terrorist threats simply by pledging more cooperation or by making marginal changes. We must be willing to make a dramatic transformation in light of the dramatic threats we face.

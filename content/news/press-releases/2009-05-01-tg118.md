**WASHINGTON **--  David S. Cohen was confirmed by the United States Senate today to serve as the Department of the Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing.  As Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing, Cohen is responsible for formulating and coordinating the counter-terrorist financing and anti-money laundering efforts of the Department of the Treasury.  In this role, Cohen will be a key member of the Obama Administration's national security team in developing financial strategies to combat such wide ranging threats as terrorism, organized crime, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.



I am pleased to welcome David back to the Treasury Department and am confident that his wealth of experience in both the private and public sectors will enable him to make invaluable contributions to protecting the U.S. and international financial system from illicit finance, said Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.



From 1999-2001, Cohen served in the Treasury Department's General Counsel's Office as, successively, Senior Counsel to the General Counsel, Associate Deputy General Counsel, and Acting Deputy General Counsel.  While in the General Counsel's Office, Cohen worked extensively with policy makers to develop and implement the Department's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies.



Cohen received his J.D. from Yale Law School in 1989, and his B.A.,*magna cum laude*, from Cornell University, in 1985.

Today’s report on GDP growth illustrates the sustained strength of the economic recovery. In the first quarter of this year the economy grew 4.2 percent, combining with the last half of 2003 for the strongest three-quarter growth rate in almost 20 years. The President’s tax relief measures have boosted economic growth and are leading to job creation. In the past seven months, American employers have added more than three-quarters of a million workers to their payrolls.
Today’s numbers suggest that America’s economy is poised for long-term growth. The continued economic leadership of the President will keep the U.S. economy on this upward path and provide for growing strength and job creation.

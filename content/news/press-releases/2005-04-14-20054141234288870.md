Secretary John W. Snow will highlight the need to simplify the U.S. tax code, as well as make President Bush's tax cuts permanent, on Tax Day. Millions of taxpayers will see their tax bill reduced thanks to the tax relief supported by President Bush. That extra money in the hands of America's families has helped fuel the economic recovery. To continue this, we must make tax relief permanent so families can plan ahead for the future. We also must reform the tax code to make it simpler, fairer and more growth oriented.

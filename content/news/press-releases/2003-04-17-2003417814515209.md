Treasury Secretary John Snow will travel to Indiana and Louisiana this week to echo President Bush's message that the nation needs quick action by Congress on a pro-growth economic package, so that people who want to find a job can find one and that people that are looking for work are able to put food on the table for their families. In his ten weeks on the job, Secretary Snow has traveled to New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Florida to discuss President Bush's proposal.

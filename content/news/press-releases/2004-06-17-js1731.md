I would like to thank the House for taking action to move the FSC/ETI process forward to eliminate sanctions. We want to increase the ability of American companies to succeed in a worldwide economy and lay the foundation for increased growth and job creation for American workers. Passing the FSC/ETI legislation is an important step toward ending the burden of the tariffs currently being imposed on U.S. exports under the WTO sanctions. We will continue our efforts to work with the Conferees to ensure that legislation is signed into law that will help us comply with our WTO obligations, is as close to budget neutral as possible, and will strengthen our economy and help manufacturers and other job creators.

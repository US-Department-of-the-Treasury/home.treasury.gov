FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

JS-722

On June 30, I outlined an Administration proposal with far-reaching consequences for all Americans. It would broaden the availability of credit, give consumers greater access to their credit records, and equip consumers and law enforcers with important new tools in the fight against identity theft.

Last night, by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives approved legislation to implement our proposal. I congratulate the House on this prompt action. Americans need these tools, and the House has acted without delay.

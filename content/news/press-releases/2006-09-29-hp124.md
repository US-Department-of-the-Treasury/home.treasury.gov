Preliminary data from the annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2005 are released today and posted on the U.S. Treasury web site at[http://www.treas.gov/tic/fpis.html](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Pages/fpis.aspx). Final survey results, which will include additional detail as well as revisions to the data, will be published on December 29, 2006.

The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

A complementary survey measuring foreign holdings of U.S. securities also is conducted annually. Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held on June 30, 2006, are currently being processed. Preliminary results are expected to be reported on March 30, 2007.

Overall Preliminary Results

The survey measured U.S. holdings at year-end 2005 of approximately $4.6 trillion, with $3.3 trillion held in foreign equities, $1.0 trillion in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $0.3 trillion in foreign short-term debt securities. The previous such survey, conducted as of year-end 2004, measured U.S. holdings of approximately $3.8 trillion, with $2.6 trillion held in foreign equities, $1.0 trillion in foreign long-term debt securities, and $0.2 trillion in foreign short-term debt securities.

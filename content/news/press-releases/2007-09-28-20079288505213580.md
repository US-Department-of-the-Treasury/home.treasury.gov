Treasury designated 14 senior Burmese Government officials this week in the wake of the longstanding oppression of the Burmese people and the Burmese government's recent use of violence against peaceful demonstrators. Treasury's action follows the President's announcement of plans for tightening U.S. sanctions against the military regime in Burma. The President has made clear that we will not stand by as the regime tries to silence the voices of the Burmese people through repression and intimidation, said OFAC Director Adam Szubin.

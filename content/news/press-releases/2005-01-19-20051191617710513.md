Secretary Snow on Wednesday swore in Anna Escobedo Cabral as the 42nd U.S. Treasurer. In her new role, Anna will reach out to all citizens to talk about some of the most important financial issues of the day, he said. For example, the promises made by Social Security are of great concern at this time. The President is leading an effort to enact Social Security reform this year, because it is clear that a lack of action would have serious implications for both the future performance of the U.S. economy, and the retirement security of our children and grandchildren.

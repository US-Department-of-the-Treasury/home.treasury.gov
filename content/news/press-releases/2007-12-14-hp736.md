  **Washington, DC--Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. today issued the following statement following the President's signing of H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act with Peru's President Alan Garcia:** Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. today issued the following statement following the President's signing of H.R. 3688, the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act with Peru's President Alan Garcia:

Today's signing demonstrates the United States' continued commitment to reducing trade barriers and spreading prosperity in the Americas. Free trade agreements are a proven way to stimulate U.S. exports, create jobs and usher in foreign investment and both of our countries will benefit from this important bipartisan accomplishment. U.S. businesses and exporters will gain access to Peru's markets while Peru will continue its economic growth and stability with an expanded trade relationship with the largest market in the world.

I look forward to working with Congress to secure passage of the other important pending free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea.

Secretary Paulson will join Canadian Finance Minister James M. Flaherty Friday in Chelsea, Quebec to sign a protocol updating the U.S.-Canada Income Tax Treaty. This is the fifth protocol signed by both countries since the original tax treaty was signed in 1980. The treaty will be signed at the historic Willson House in Gatineau Park.

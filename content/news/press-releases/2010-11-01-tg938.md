- During the October - December 2010 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $362 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $300 billion, which includes $200 billion for the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP). The borrowing estimate is $17 billion lower than announced in August 2010. The decrease in borrowing relates primarily to higher net issuances of State and Local Government Series securities and cash balance adjustments.
- During the January – March 2011 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $431 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-March cash balance of $270 billion, which includes $200 for the SFP.
During the July – September 2010 quarter, Treasury issued $396 billion in net marketable debt, and finished the quarter with a cash balance of $310 billion, of which $200 billion was attributable to the SFP. In August, Treasury estimated $350 billion in net marketable borrowing and assumed an end-of-September cash balance of $270 billion, which included an SFP balance of $200 billion. The higher cash balance resulted from the additional borrowing. Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, November 3.. ###

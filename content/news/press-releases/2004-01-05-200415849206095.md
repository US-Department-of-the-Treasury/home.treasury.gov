On Wednesday January 7th, Treasury Secretary John Snow will deliver a keynote address at the National Chamber Foundation event “Outlook 2004: The State of American Business.”  Recent evidence demonstrates the U.S. economy is improving.  On January 2, the Purchasing Managers’ Index report suggests progress in manufacturing. December’s index was above the breakeven 50 level for the sixth straight month and at the highest level in twenty years. The new orders index posted the strongest showing in over fifty years. The report also suggests a better employment picture -- further evidence the President’s initiatives are creating economic growth and boosting job creation.

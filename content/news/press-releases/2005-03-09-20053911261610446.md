Secretary John W. Snow today addressed the American Bankers Association inWashington, D.C., where he highlighted the importance of strengthening the Social Security system. President Bush has established some basic principles. He wants to preserve benefits for current and near-retirees while saving and strengthening the system for future generations, he said. For future generations of retirees, the President believes an awful lot of hope lies in personal accounts – something that would allow younger workers to build a nest egg that they own and control.

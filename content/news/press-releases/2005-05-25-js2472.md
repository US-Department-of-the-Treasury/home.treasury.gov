JS-2472

 

Today's action by the House Financial Services Committee on GSE reform legislation moves the process forward.

As the process continues, we will be working with the House and Senate to ensure that the bill is strengthened so that the final product provides for a strong, independent regulator which has all the necessary tools to do the job. Directing the regulator to place limits on the size of the GSE's retained mortgage portfolio is a critical element of reform.

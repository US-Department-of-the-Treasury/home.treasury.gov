**Washington , DC --**Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. today issued the following statement on the House of Representatives vote to change Trade Promotion Authority rules:

The Trade Promotion Authority process has served America well, enabling us to open markets around the world to U.S. exports.And today, exports are the bright spot in our economy. I can't recall another time when trade has played such a vital role in creating jobs for American workers. Changing the rules in the middle of the game is fundamentally unfair to Colombia, a good friend of the United States, and to all those in the region who have stood with Colombia as it has created stability and opportunity for its people.Changing the TPA process could have lasting impact, undermining our country's ability going forward to open foreign markets to American goods and services.It also sends an unwelcomed signal to global markets at an economically sensitive time. I urge the Congress not to chip away at an agreed process, and in so doing isolate US workers from opportunities around the globe.

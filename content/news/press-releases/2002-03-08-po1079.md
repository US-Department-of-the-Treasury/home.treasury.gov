**TREASURY SECRETARY PAUL O'NEILL STATEMENT ON SENATE PASSAGE OF THE JOB CREATION AND WORKER ASSISTANCE ACT**

I applaud the Senate for following the lead of the House and promptly passing the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act, legislation which contains many of the provisions President Bush has been calling for since last October.



As President Bush said, this bill not only takes care of unemployed workers, it also has tax relief for employers to create and retain jobs as a major part of it. This legislation will add momentum so that we have a more robust economic recovery and return to full prosperity.



Make no mistake; this legislation is about jobs. President Bush has insisted that it is not enough to help people out of work unless we can also help them get back to work. This legislation will do that - it will speed American back to work and help the unemployed until they return to work.



This is a great victory for American workers and their families.

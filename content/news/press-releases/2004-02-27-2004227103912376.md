The economy continues to strengthen. A report this week on durable goods suggests continued rapid growth in business capital investment. This shows that the incentives contained in the President’s Jobs and Growth plan are working.

Last year ended with a strong growth rate of 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter. The last half of 2003 saw the fastest rate of GDP growth in nearly 20 years and the economy looks to continue growing at levels above historical rates. We’re encouraged by the continuing positive momentum we’re seeing in the economy, but there remains more to be done. This Administration is committed to strengthening the environment for job creation and seeks to ensure that jobs are available for all those looking for work.

JS-532



Today, the Treasury Department and the IRS issued proposed regulations to conform with a change made by the Economic Growth and Taxpayer Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) concerning optional forms of payment from a defined contribution plan.



EGTRRA permits optional forms of payment to be eliminated from a defined contribution plan if the plan offers a single-sum distribution form.  In light of a participant's ability to roll over a single-sum distribution from a defined contribution plan into an individual retirement account and replicate virtually any form of distribution available under the plan, regulations that were finalized in 2000 only differ from section 411(d)(6)(E) by requiring advance notice to participants.  These proposed regulations would conform the 2000 regulations to the new EGTRRA requirements by eliminating the advance notice.



The proposed regulations would be effective on publication of final regulations.

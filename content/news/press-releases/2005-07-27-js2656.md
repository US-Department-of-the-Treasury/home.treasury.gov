I urge Congress to move quickly to pass the energy legislation that has now emerged from the conference committee. The enactment of this bill is needed to address high energy prices, which act like a tax on our economy. It will help American workers, families and businesses. It will also decrease our dependence on foreign sources of energy, and increase energy efficiency and conservation. This is bi-partisan, comprehensive energy legislation that reflects the priorities of the President's 2001 proposal. The American economy stands to benefit from it. Congress should deliver it to the President before its August recess.

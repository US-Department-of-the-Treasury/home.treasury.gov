The Senate's vote to fund fully the IMF is a major step toward providing the IMF with the resources necessary to deal with risks to financial stability around the world. An IMF with sufficient resources to respond to threats of financial instability is critically important to the well being of American workers, businesses and farmers.

The overwhelming bipartisan support for IMF funding is indicative of the importance of this issue to our national security interests and the economic well being of American workers, businesses and farmers. We will continue to work with Congress to achieve full funding for the IMF as soon as possible.

WASHINGTON – Today, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo met with Los Angeles tenants and landlords to discuss how the American Rescue Plan’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) is helping prevent evictions and ensure housing security in Southern California. The meeting was hosted by New Economics for Women (NEW), an economic development corporation created and operated by Latina women. The Deputy Secretary received a tour of the Tierra del Sol affordable housing community, located in the Canoga Park area of Los Angeles. He then met with tenants and landlords to discuss their experiences participating in ERAP. Deputy Secretary Adeyemo noted the benefits of delivering ERAP assistance to vulnerable households through partnerships with community-based nonprofits that provide culturally relevant services.  Deputy Secretary Adeyemo also made clear that he and the Secretary Yellen are committed to providing our nation’s most vulnerable households access to affordable and stable housing, particularly those impacted by the affordable housing challenges exacerbated by COVID-19.

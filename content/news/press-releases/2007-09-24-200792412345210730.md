To build on the discussions that Secretary Paulson has had with members of Congress in both parties, Treasury released the first in a series of issue briefs that will discuss Social Security reform, focusing on the nature of the problem and those aspects of reform that have broad support. By focusing first on areas of agreement, I hope these issue briefs will narrow the divide and spur further discussions of reform, said Paulson.

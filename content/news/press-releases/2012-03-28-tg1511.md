**WASHINGTON** –President Obama’s nominee to the World Bank presidency, Dr. Jim Yong Kim, met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame Tuesday evening in Washington to discuss the importance of the World Bank’s role in reducing poverty and supporting development for global economic growth.

 

“I was delighted to learn that Jim Kim has been nominated for this post, as he is a true friend of Africa and well known for his decade of work to support us in developing an efficient health system in Rwanda,” said President Kagame on Friday, March 23.  “He’s not only a physician and a leader who knows what it takes to address poverty, but also a genuinely good person. President Obama’s nomination of Dr. Kim as President of the World Bank is a welcome one, and should resonate well with the many men and women who are working to transform lives around the world.

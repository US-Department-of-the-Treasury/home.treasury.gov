  The International Compact with Iraq, an initiative launched by the UN and Iraq to help Iraq realize its vision of a stable and prosperous nation underpinned by a self-sustaining economy, will be signed next month in Sharm el-Sheik, Egypt on May 3. I commend the Iraqi authorities for their sustained commitment to the Compact. Iraq, together with the United Nations and the World Bank, has worked diligently since July 2006 to prepare the ambitious economic reform framework outlined in the Compact, said Dpty Sec Kimmitt, Presidential Special Envoy for the Compact.   The signing ceremony concludes several months of hard work and provides a concrete path of reform to financial self sufficiency.

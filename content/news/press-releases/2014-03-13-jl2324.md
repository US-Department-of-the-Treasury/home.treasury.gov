  **WASHINGTON** – Today, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew met with Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk to discuss the Ukrainian government’s economic reform plans, the U.S. assistance package for Ukraine, and Ukraine’s discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about a potential loan program.   During the meeting, Secretary Lew and Prime Minister Yatsenyuk discussed the ongoing IMF mission and the importance of Ukraine taking ownership of the reform agenda to restore its financial stability and economic growth.  Secretary Lew emphasized that the international community stands ready to support Ukraine as the government implements these necessary reforms. The Secretary and the Prime Minister agreed that securing passage of IMF quota legislation is needed to maximize the international community’s support to Ukraine.   Secretary Lew outlined the possible U.S. loan guarantee and its conditions, which would complement the international assistance and require Congressional approval. He noted that the Ukrainian government’s willingness to commit to ambitious reforms would impact the timing of the guarantee, and asked for Prime Minister Yatsenyuk’s suggestions about how the loan agreement could be structured to facilitate this.**###**​

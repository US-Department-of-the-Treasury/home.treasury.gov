I applaud the House for voting to prevent a tax hike on hard-working married couples. We are one step closer to allowing more than 30 million people keep more of their own money to help pay for their children's education, invest for their retirement, and spend as they see fit. I hope the Senate acts quickly to end the marriage penalty and provide millions of Americans with the permanent tax relief they deserve, stated Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill.

FROM THE OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS

LS-205

We applaud last night's approval by the House Banking Committee of priority legislation to provide debt relief to millions of people in the world's poorest countries. The Committee's bipartisan action is an important step forward toward making the historic international initiative for Highly Indebted Poor Countries a reality in the Jubilee year. In the days ahead, we look forward to continuing this urgent work with the Congress in the final budget discussions now underway.

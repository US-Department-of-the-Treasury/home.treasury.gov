Today's employment report is good news for American families, showing that the American economy is expanding steadily, with 33 straight months of job growth and unemployment now at a very low rate of 4.6 percent.  

I was particularly pleased to see that the unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans is now at a record low of five percent. This news should reaffirm Hispanic Americans' sense of optimism about the economic and employment opportunities available to all Americans. Thanks to the President's sound economic policies, the promise of the American dream is alive and well.

**Washington** – *U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump issued the following statements today following President Trump’s nomination of David Malpass to serve as President of the World Bank:*



***Secretary Mnuchin***



“President Trump has made an excellent choice by nominating [David Malpass](https://home.treasury.gov/about/general-information/officials/david-malpass) to serve as President of the World Bank. David has worked closely with me at the Treasury Department and understands the President’s pro-growth economic agenda that has led to the strongest U.S. economy and job market in generations. As Under Secretary, he successfully negotiated a capital increase and reform package to focus the World Bank on its core mission of lifting up the standard of living in lower-income countries. I look forward to continue working with David in his new role.”



***Advisor to the President Ivanka Trump***



“David’s extensive knowledge of the World Bank’s challenges and opportunities make him a uniquely qualified steward of a great institution that is operating below its full potential. David’s leadership was invaluable in the design and implementation of the World Bank’s Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) and I look forward to continuing our work together to realize the mission of the Bank, to eliminate poverty and build prosperity, by economically empowering women in the developing world.”

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated five individuals for providing financial support to al Qaida and other terrorist organizations, as well as facilitating terrorist activity. These individuals support every stage of the terrorist life-cycle, from financing terrorist groups and activity, to facilitating deadly attacks, and inciting others to join campaigns of violence and hate.  The civilized world must stand united in isolating these terrorists, said Stuart Levey, Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.

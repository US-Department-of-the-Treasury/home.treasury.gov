Good evening.Thank you for inviting me to speak at the Chamber's Annual Gala Ball.Engaging with business leaders tonight is a fitting end to a day when finance and foreign ministers from the Broader Middle East and North African gathered inRabatto discuss political and economic reform with their counterparts from the United Statesand the other G8 countries.

That finance ministers and foreign ministers were meeting together is of symbolic and substantive significance because it underscores the close link between economic and political reform. As Secretary Powell said in the meeting, Political freedom and economic freedom go hand in hand.Ourhope is that the decisions made today will create a strong foundation for both economic and political freedom that will benefit the people of the Broader Middle East andNorth Africa.

But tonight I want to focus on economic freedom.The overarching objective of economic reforms is to promote sustained economic growth strong enough to create jobs for the region's rapidly growing population, to raise incomes, and to reduce poverty.The broad consensus is that strong economic growth is achievable only when governments adopt economic policies that enable entrepreneurs to become the main driver of growth.

The Moroccan government has already demonstrated its recognition of the private sector's role in generating strong economic growth.The Moroccan government's commitment to the privatization of state-owned enterprises, its efforts to increase the transparency of government decision-making, and the liberalization of its trade policy are all visible examples of this recognition.

Moreover,Moroccocan play a key leadership role in promoting economic reform throughout the Broader Middle East and North African region.Statist economic policies embraced by Middle Eastern countries for so many years have prevented the region from achieving its full economic potential.The most powerful advocates for economic change in the region are reform-oriented countries such asMorocco.

TheUnited Statesand other developed nations also have an important role to play by supporting reforming countries and by encouraging further reform.The U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement andMorocco's eligibility for funding from the Millennium Challenge Account are two examples of such support and encouragement.Moroccois the only country in the region that is both eligible for MCA funding and has negotiated a Free Trade Agreement with the United States.

The Millennium Challenge Account was specifically designed to target our development resources to those countries where economic reforms are taking place.Moroccowas the only new country selected for MCA funding in 2005 thanks to its strong performance in the three broad policy categories:Ruling Justly, Investing in People, and Encouraging Economic Freedom.Moroccoscored particularly high in the anti-corruption indicator.

Nonetheless there remains room for improvement. Within the Economic Freedom category, for instance,Moroccoperformed below the average on the fiscal policy indicator due to its high and rising fiscal deficit.Hence, the government must reform taxation and control spending in order to bring this indicator into line.

The business community can help ensure that MCA funding is directed towards projects that increase economic growth.The development of an MCA compact and specific proposals involves an open consultative process.I would encourage you to begin thinking about how the MCA can further the process of economic reform inMorocco.

The Free Trade Agreement, which was ratified by the United Statesin August and now awaits approval by your Parliament, is another indicator ofU.S.support forMorocco's economic reform.The agreement, which would eliminate ninety-five percent of all tariffs on bilateral trade in industrial and consumer goods once in force, represents the best market access package of any U.S. Free Trade Area with a developing country signed to date.It falls to the Moroccan private sector to take advantage of this generous access and spur Moroccan growth through increased exports.

The agreement rewards the economic reforms undertaken by your government.In entering into the agreement,Moroccoallowed financial firms greater access to the Moroccan market, thereby increasing competition in this key sector and supporting further liberalization.The agreement provides strong legal protections forU.S.investors, a framework which if extended to all foreign investors could help boost foreign investment flows toMorocco.The private sector benefits from the FTA therefore include not only the expanded trade opportunities arising from duty free access toU.S.markets, but also improved economic policies.

Morocco's commitment to reform sends a clear signal to other countries in the region that a market-oriented economy that is open to trade and investment is the surest path to sustainable growth a theory that is borne out in recent economic data.From 2000 to 2003Morocco's real GDP growth was about 4 percent per year, above the average of 3 percent for regional non-oil producing countries during the same period.

The work of economic reformers, however, never seems to be done.You the leaders ofMorocco's private sector must continue to be forceful advocates for economic reform withinMorocco.And the United Stateswill continue to supportMorocco's reform efforts and those of other countries in the Broader Middle East andNorth Africaregion.Together we can encourage economic freedom that will improve people's lives here inMoroccoand throughout the region.

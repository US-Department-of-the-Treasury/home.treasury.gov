​   **WASHINGTON** –“Mary Jo White has been a tireless leader in the effort to ensure that our financial markets are safe, secure and fair to investors and the public alike.  Her deep experience as both a federal prosecutor and securities lawyer has been a great source of strength for the SEC, having skillfully steered the commission to develop enhanced investor protection regulations so critical to maintaining the public’s trust in our financial markets.   “She has been an important partner to me within the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), making our financial markets more safe and transparent through the SEC’s adoption of important money market funds structural reforms.  Additionally, the FSOC’s important review of asset management products and activities has been complementary to the regulatory reforms that the SEC has undertaken to enhance risk monitoring and regulatory safeguards in this area.   “Under Mary Jo’s stewardship, the SEC has reduced risks to our financial stability and recognized that it must adapt to new trends in markets to provide effective oversight.  I am thankful for her leadership and I wish her the best in her future endeavors.”

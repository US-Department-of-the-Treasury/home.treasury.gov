JS-724

We welcome the agreement between IMF management and the Government of Argentina on a medium-term program.  The United States expects to support the program when it is submitted to the IMF Executive Board for approval next week.



With strong implementation by Argentina of the program's macroeconomic framework and reform measures, and with a good faith effort to reach prompt agreement on a comprehensive debt restructuring, the program can help Argentina lay the basis for sustained growth and rising living standards.

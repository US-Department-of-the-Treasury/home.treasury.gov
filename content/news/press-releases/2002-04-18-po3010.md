I applaud the House for voting to prevent the largest tax increase in history in 2011, and making sure that death will cease to be a taxable event, the child credit will increase, the marriage penalty will be reduced, and retirement and education savings options will be expanded. I hope the Senate acts quickly to provide millions of hard-working Americans with the permanent tax relief they deserve, stated Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill.

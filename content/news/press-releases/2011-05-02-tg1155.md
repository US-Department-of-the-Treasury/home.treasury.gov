- During the April – June 2011 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $142 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-June cash balance of $95 billion, which includes $5 billion for the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP).This borrowing estimate is $156 billion lower than announced in January 2011.The decrease in borrowing largely relates to higher receipts and lower outlays.
 
- During the July – September 2011 quarter, Treasury expects to issue $405 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $115 billion, which includes $5 billion for the SFP.
  During the January – March 2011 quarter, Treasury issued $265 billion in net marketable debt, and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $118 billion, of which $5 billion was attributable to the SFP.  In January 2011, Treasury estimated $237 billion in net marketable borrowing and assumed an end-of-March cash balance of $65 billion, which included an SFP balance of $5 billion.  The higher cash balance resulted primarily from higher receipts and lower outlays.   Additional financing details relating to Treasury’s Quarterly Refunding will be released at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, May 4, 2011.   ###

The Small Business Administration celebrates National Small Business Week with events in Washington and New York. Since 1963 the president has proclaimed the week as formal recognition of the important role small businesses play in the economy and our communities. Small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, and my Administration is committed to fostering an environment in which the entrepreneurial spirit can thrive. By keeping taxes low, we leave more money in the hands of Americans to save, spend, and invest, said President Bush.

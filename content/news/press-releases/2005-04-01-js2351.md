This week, the announcement of two vital economic indicators continues to show America's economy is on the right path. Today's announcement that the unemployment rate fell to 5.2% and 110,000 new jobs have been created is good news for the direction of America's economy. That makes for over 3 million new jobs since May 2003. For 2004, the Gross Domestic Product was 3.9 percent, which is yet another sign that America's economy is flourishing.

  

President Bush is committed to keeping the economy on the path of healthy growth by cutting the deficit in half, enacting an energy policy, and strengthening social security. The President's leadership on economic policy is clearly moving the economy in the right direction.

The United States welcomes the IMF Board’s agreement to support a framework for completing negotiations on a transitional program for Argentina. Such a transitional program can help strengthen stabilization of the economic and financial situation in the period leading up to the election and installation of a new government. In January, the Argentine authorities and the IMF are expected to finalize a suitable monetary and fiscal framework. If approved by the IMF Board, the program will provide resources during the political transition, but will not increase Argentina’s debt to the IMF. As strong implementation is critical to program success, we welcome Argentina’s commitment to strictly adhere to the agreed framework. Argentina is also expected to clear its arrears and service its obligations to the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. Over the coming months, the international community will continue to work with Argentina to develop a longer-term program geared toward restoring a path of sustainable growth.

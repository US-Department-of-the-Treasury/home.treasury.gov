Secretary Henry M. Paulson, Jr. travels to Latin America today to discuss economic progress in the region as well as the region's efforts to bring new opportunities, continued poverty reduction and an expanded middle class to its people. Latin America has been a long-time interest for Secretary Paulson and is a key priority for him as Treasury Secretary. My goal is to work with leaders in the region to ensure that more people share in the benefits created by economic growth and trade opportunities, said Paulson.

**WASHINGTON -**Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Neal S. Wolin today issued this statement following the President’s signing of H.R. 6431, a bill to provide flexibility to support assistance by International Financial Institutions to Burma:



“In enacting this bill, the President and Congress have demonstrated strong U.S. support for the critical role of the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) in helping promote stronger institutions to ensure sound economic policy and good governance in Burma. This will support inclusive development in Burma and help reintegrate the country into the international economic community.  The law provides the Administration with the flexibility to determine, in the national interest, whether to support, abstain on or vote against IFI financial assistance for Burma.  Implementation of this law will provide the United States with the ability to shape the policies and activities of these institutions in a way that advances reform, good governance, transparency, and accountability in Burma.”

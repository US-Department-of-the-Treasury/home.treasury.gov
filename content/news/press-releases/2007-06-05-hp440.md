HP-440



I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Senator Craig Thomas. In my short time inWashington, I have had the great pleasure of getting to know him and work with him.  He was an exceptional advocate for the people of Wyoming and a steadfast friend to the Treasury Department.  He will be deeply missed by all of us.

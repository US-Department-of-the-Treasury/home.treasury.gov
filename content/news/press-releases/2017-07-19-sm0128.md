**​ WASHINGTON**– Upon completion of the first meeting of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, Co-Chairs Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary Wilbur Ross released the following statement:

“We thank Vice Premier Wang and the Chinese delegation for making the journey to Washington for this first session of the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue.

“We also extend our gratitude to Secretary Perdue, Ambassador Lighthizer, Ambassador Branstad, Chair Yellen and Director Cohn for their participation in these meetings.

“China acknowledged our shared objective to reduce the trade deficit which both sides will work cooperatively to achieve.

“Since the Presidential Summit, the first 100 days made progress on important issues including credit ratings, bond clearing, electronic payments, commercial banking, and liquefied natural gas.  Also, this is the first time since 2003 that the Chinese have allowed for imports of American beef.

“The principles of balance, fairness, and reciprocity on matters of trade will continue to guide the American position so we can give American workers and businesses an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. We look to achieving the important goals set forth by President Trump this past April in Mar-a-Lago.”

Treasury Secretary John Snow will travel to St. Louis, Missouri and Little Rock, Arkansas on December 4th and 5th to discuss the state of the economy, as well as efforts by President Bush to create jobs, strengthen the economic recovery and increase workers' standards of living. 

In St. Louis, Secretary Snow will tour a construction site, meet with local construction industry leaders, and tour a vocational school that is teaching students job skills.  The construction industry, an important segment of the overall U.S. economy, is showing signs of improvement.   The Commerce Department this week reported that construction spending increased 0.9 percent in October, to a record $922 billion annual rate.

While in Little Rock, Secretary Snow will meet with regional business leaders and tour Raytheon Aircraft's Hawker completion facility.  A well-respected gauge of manufacturing activity released this week hit its highest level in almost two decades, showing that our manufacturing sector is getting stronger.

In Missouri, more than 1.7 million taxpayers have lower income tax bills as a result of the President's tax relief efforts.  In Arkansas, more than 700,000 taxpayers are benefiting.

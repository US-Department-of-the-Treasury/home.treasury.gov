Secretary Paulson commended the Senate today on passage of the Free Trade Agreement with Peru. Free trade agreements are a proven way to increase exports of U.S. goods and agricultural products and are essential for continued job creation and protecting U.S. investments, the Secretary said. The agreement was passed last month by the House of Representatives.

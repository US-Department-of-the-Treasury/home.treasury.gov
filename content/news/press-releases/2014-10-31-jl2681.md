**WASHINGTON** – The findings from the annual survey of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2013 were released today and posted on the Treasury web site at [https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system-home-page/tic-forms-instructions/securities-c-annual-cross-us-border-portfolio-holdings](https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system-home-page/tic-forms-instructions/securities-c-annual-cross-us-border-portfolio-holdings).   The survey was undertaken jointly by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.    A complementary survey measuring foreign holdings of U.S. securities is also conducted annually.  Data from the most recent such survey, which reports on securities held at end-June 2014, are currently being processed. Preliminary results are expected to be reported on February 27, 2015.   Overall Results   This survey measured the value of U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities at year-end 2013 as approximately $9.1 trillion, with $6.5 trillion held in foreign equity, $2.3 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities (original term-to-maturity in excess of one year), and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities.  The previous such survey, conducted as of year-end 2012, measured U.S. holdings of approximately $8.0 trillion, with $5.3 trillion held in foreign equity, $2.3 trillion held in foreign long-term debt securities, and $0.4 trillion held in foreign short-term debt securities. The largest gain occurred in equities, reflecting gains in global stock markets.   U.S. portfolio holdings of foreign securities by country at the end of 2013 were the largest for the United Kingdom ($1.344 trillion), followed by the Cayman Islands ($901 billion), Canada ($826 billion), and Japan ($686 billion) (see Table 2). These four countries attracted 41 percent of total U.S. portfolio investment. The surveys are part of an internationally coordinated effort under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to improve the measurement of portfolio asset holdings.** Table 1.  U.S. holdings of foreign securities, by type of security, as of survey dates [1]** (Billions of dollars)   Type of Security Dec. 31, 2012 Dec. 31, 2013       Long-term Securities 7,593 8,777                 Equity 5,322 6,473                 Long-term debt 2,271 2,305 Short-term debt securities 365 353       Total 7,958 9,130       U.S. Portfolio Investment by Country ** Table 2.  Market value of U.S. holdings of foreign securities, by country and type of security, for the countries attracting the most U.S. investment, as of December 31, 2013 [1]**

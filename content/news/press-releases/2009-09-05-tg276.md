"Today, the Administration announced steps we are taking to make it easier for working families to save, particularly for retirement.  Working Americans should be able to retire with dignity and security, but nearly half of the nation's workforce has little or nothing beyond Social Security benefits to get by on in old age.  The measures we are announcing today will give more choices to families who want to save, and will complement the Administration's legislative proposals to expand retirement savings.  Just as the Administration is dedicated to reviving the economy and getting people back to work, so too it is dedicated to helping put retirement security within the reach of all Americans."

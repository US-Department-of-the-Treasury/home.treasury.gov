9/11 was something we all experienced, although certainly not equally. No one bore the pain and hardship of September 11th more than those who lost loved ones and then those who sacrificed in the conflicts that came after. To those who bear the scars of 9/11 in those ways, I want you to know I’m thinking about you this weekend.

It strikes me that we’ve come to know the event by a single date – 9/11 – but its legacy has been an inextricable part of every one of the roughly 7,000 days that have come since. It changed the way we think about our safety, about our country and its place in the world. At the Treasury Department, it changed the way people worked, too.

Two decades after the September 11th attacks, I wanted to pay special tribute to the Treasury staff who have devoted their careers to tracking and disrupting the money flows of terrorists. They have quite literally created the discipline of financial intelligence from scratch, and in the process, kept our country safe.

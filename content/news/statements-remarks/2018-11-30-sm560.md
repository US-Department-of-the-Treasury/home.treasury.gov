**Washington **– The Department of Finance Canada, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit of Mexico, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury are pleased to announce the establishment of the Canada-Mexico-United States Financial Regulatory Forum.

The Financial Regulatory Forum will provide an annual venue for Canada, Mexico, and the United States to share information and exchange views on cross-border issues, emerging financial sector developments, financial stability risks, and regulatory practices with the ultimate goal of advancing regulatory cooperation.

The financial sectors of Canada, Mexico, and the United States are highly integrated, and investment in these sectors accounts for a significant and growing portion of cross-border trade and investment across North America.  These trends underscore the importance for our three countries to work together to manage common risks and to promote open and efficient markets.

Statement from Twitter— Secretary Janet Yellen:

From the window at Treasury, I can see the flag at the White House is lowered to half-staff now. It’s heartbreaking.

Asian-Americans are suffering a rising tide of hate and violence in this country. It’s a trend that must be recognized, halted, and reversed.

**Washington **– U.S. Treasury Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tony Sayegh issued the following statement on Panama’s efforts to combat corruption by the Maduro regime:

“The United States commends Panama for its courageous efforts to safeguard its financial system from abuse by corrupt Venezuelan officials. Venezuelan government officials continue to exploit the international financial system to move and hide the proceeds of public corruption, including those related to government contracts and resources. We urge the international community to stand with Panama and identify and investigate individuals and entities at high-risk of being involved in Venezuelan public corruption. We support the Venezuelan people’s efforts to restore democracy and bring prosperity to their country.”

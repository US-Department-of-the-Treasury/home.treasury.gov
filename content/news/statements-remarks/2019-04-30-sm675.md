**Washington**– Today, the Department of the Treasury issued a statement in support of efforts underway in Venezuela to restore democracy.  This statement can be attributed to a Treasury spokesperson:

“The United States stands with the Venezuelan people and interim President Juan Guaido in opposition to the illegitimate Maduro regime.  The path to sanctions relief for individuals and entities aligned with the former Maduro regime, including institutions such as PdVSA, is to change behavior by supporting Venezuela’s democratically elected leader and those who seek to restore democracy.  The United States and our partners and allies stand ready to leverage the tools of the international financial community to help swiftly restart Venezuela’s economy.  This Administration will continue to hold accountable those who stand in the way of restoring democracy to Venezuela.”

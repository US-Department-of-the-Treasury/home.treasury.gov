WASHINGTON — Earlier today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen met with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva to discuss this year’s Article IV consultation with the United States. Secretary Yellen stressed the importance of candid and thorough assessments of all IMF member economies through the annual surveillance process.  They discussed the key economic priorities of the Biden-Harris Administration and the continued need to respond effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic, address the threat of climate change, and the transformative potential of the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan.

In line with the United States’ longstanding support for enhanced economic transparency globally, the Treasury Department will publish all U.S. Article IV documents on its website, including the IMF’s concluding statement and staff report and the U.S. statement in response to the report.

**Washington** – The Treasury Department today released the concluding statement following this year’s Article IV consultation at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  Release of the IMF’s statement is consistent with the United States’ longstanding support for enhanced economic transparency globally.  We will also publish the IMF staff report and the IMF public information notice on the U.S. Article IV review following the Executive Board’s discussion later this month.

This year’s consultations included productive discussions about the U.S. economy and the Administration’s economic policy objectives.  While we appreciate the IMF’s work on their report and share similar short term forecasts on U.S. economic growth, we differ significantly on the medium and long term projections.  The Treasury Department believes that our policies, including the productivity-boosting mix of tax reform and regulatory relief, will result in more sustainable economic growth.

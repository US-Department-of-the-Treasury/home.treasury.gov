**WASHINGTON**– U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin today issued the following statement on the proposed appointment of Acting Assistant Secretary Geoffrey Okamoto as First Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund:

“I applaud Managing Director Georgieva’s proposal to appoint Geoffrey Okamoto as First Deputy Managing Director of the IMF.  As Acting Assistant Secretary for International Finance and Development and Acting Under Secretary for International Affairs, Geoffrey Okamoto has played a key role in the some of the most consequential trade, development, and international monetary policy issues facing our nation and the world.  His leadership in China trade negotiations, bilateral and multilateral engagements through the G7 and G20, and U.S. participation in international financial institutions, has been invaluable.  His deep expertise on policies to stabilize countries experiencing economic shocks, and effective management skills, will be an asset to the Fund, its member countries, and all those the IMF serves.”

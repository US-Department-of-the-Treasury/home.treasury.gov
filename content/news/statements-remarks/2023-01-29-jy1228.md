Today, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo released the following statement on the Inflation Reduction Act’s strong labor protections’ going into effect:

“The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to taking steps to make sure clean energy jobs are good-paying jobs and that American workers are ready to take on the opportunities created by the Inflation Reduction Act’s investments. Strong labor protections are now in place, and workers on these projects will see higher paychecks and more opportunities. This marks the first time that workers on projects supported by clean energy tax incentives will benefit from protections on pay that have long benefitted workers on projects supported by federal contracts. Treasury’s guidance to implement this critical piece of the Inflation Reduction Act ensures that workers benefit from the clean energy economy they are building.”

Today’s passage of the United States-Canada-Mexico Agreement (USMCA) negotiated by Ambassador Lighthizer and the U.S. team is another big step forward in advancing President Trump’s trade agenda.  As the President promised, the agreement is a significant achievement in modernizing and rebalancing our trade relationship with Canada and Mexico, delivering a more level playing field for American workers, generating American jobs, and bolstering our competitiveness abroad. Ratification of USMCA will build upon the remarkable economic success of the last two and a half years and further strengthen the U.S. economy.

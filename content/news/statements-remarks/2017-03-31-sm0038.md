**Washington**— Secretary of the Treasury Steven T. Mnuchin today sent a letter to Walter M. Schaub, Jr., Director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.  Below is a statement on the letter that can be attributed to a Treasury spokesperson:
 
“During a series of light-hearted questions at the end of a long interview last week, Secretary Mnuchin was asked whether he had any movie recommendations.  The Secretary’s responses were made in jest and not intended to be a product endorsement of any movie.  We think that’s clear in context.  The Secretary wrote the Office of Government Ethics today to reiterate that his answer referring to a children’s movie was not intended to be an official product endorsement—as he said during the interview.  The Secretary is fully committed to ensuring a high standard of ethical conduct at the Department of Treasury.”

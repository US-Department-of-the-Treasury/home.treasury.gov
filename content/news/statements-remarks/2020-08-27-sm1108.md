WASHINGTON –*U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement upon the conclusion of the African Development Bank Annual Meeting:*

“I commend the African Development Bank’s Board of Governors for reaffirming its commitment to the highest standards of governance and taking the opportunity at its Annual Meeting this week to dedicate resources to update its ethics governing framework.  I also congratulate President Akinwumi Adesina on the strong shareholder support that led to his re-election.

### Partnership with the St. Louis Federal Reserve

The U.S. Department of the Treasury, in partnership with the St. Louis Federal Reserve, has recently digitized 452 volumes of press releases. The volumes consist of approximately 40,000 releases from 1916 to 2009. These documents provide an overview of America’s financial history from World War I to the Financial Crisis of 2007-09. The full FRASER collection for the Treasury includes statements and speeches from Treasury officials, data releases, policy documents, and more. The collection will continue to expand as the FRASER team works to capture “born-digital” Treasury releases from 2009 to the present.

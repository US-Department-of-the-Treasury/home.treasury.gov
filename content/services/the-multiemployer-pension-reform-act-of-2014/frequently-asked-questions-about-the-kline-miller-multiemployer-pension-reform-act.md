## Frequently Asked Questions About MPRA

The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA), also known as the Kline-Miller Act, made significant changes to the rules governing multiemployer pension plans.

### General Questions

#### What is a multiemployer pension plan?
A multiemployer pension plan is a collectively bargained pension plan maintained by two or more employers, typically in the same industry or geographic area.

#### What is MPRA?
MPRA is legislation enacted in 2014 that provides new tools for troubled multiemployer pension plans, including the ability to suspend benefits under certain conditions.

#### Why was MPRA enacted?
Some multiemployer plans face severe financial challenges that could lead to insolvency. MPRA provides options to address these challenges.

### Critical and Declining Status

#### What is critical and declining status?
A plan is in critical and declining status if it is in critical status and is projected to become insolvent within 15-20 years.

#### How is this status determined?
The plan's actuary certifies the status annually based on projected funding and benefit obligations.

### Benefit Suspensions

#### Can any plan suspend benefits?
No. Only plans in critical and declining status may apply to suspend benefits, and only if other reasonable measures are insufficient.

#### What benefits can be suspended?
Benefits may be reduced, subject to protections for:
- Participants age 80+ (fully protected)
- Participants ages 75-80 (partially protected)
- Disability benefits (protected)

#### Do participants get to vote?
Yes. After Treasury approval, participants vote on the proposed suspension.

### American Rescue Plan Impact

#### What is the Special Financial Assistance program?
The American Rescue Plan created a program providing financial assistance to eligible multiemployer plans, potentially eliminating the need for suspensions.

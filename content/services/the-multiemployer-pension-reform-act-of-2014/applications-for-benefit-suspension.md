The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (MPRA) allows certain financially troubled multiemployer pension plans to apply to Treasury for approval to suspend benefits.

### Background

MPRA permits trustees of multiemployer pension plans that are projected to become insolvent to apply to reduce or suspend benefits if:
- The plan is in critical and declining status
- All reasonable measures have been taken
- Suspension is necessary to avoid insolvency

### Application Process

1. **Plan Determination** - Trustees determine plan is in critical and declining status
2. **Proposal Development** - Develop proposed benefit suspensions
3. **Participant Notice** - Notify participants and beneficiaries
4. **Application Submission** - Submit application to Treasury
5. **Treasury Review** - Treasury reviews for compliance with MPRA
6. **Participant Vote** - If approved, participants vote on suspension
7. **Final Determination** - Treasury makes final decision

### Treasury Review Criteria

Treasury reviews applications to ensure:
- Plan is in critical and declining status
- All reasonable measures have been taken
- Suspension is reasonably estimated to avoid insolvency
- Suspension is equitably distributed
- Required notices were provided

### Protected Benefits

MPRA protects certain benefits from suspension:
- Benefits for participants age 80 and older (full protection)
- Benefits for participants ages 75-80 (partial protection)
- Disability benefits

### American Rescue Plan

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 created the Special Financial Assistance program:
- Provides assistance to financially troubled plans
- May reduce need for benefit suspensions
- Administered by PBGC

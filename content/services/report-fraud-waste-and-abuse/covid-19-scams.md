If you receive calls, emails, or other communications claiming to be from the Treasury Department and offering COVID-19 related grants or stimulus payments in exchange for personal financial information, or an advance fee, or charge of any kind, including the purchase of gift cards, please do not respond. These are scams.

Please contact the FBI at [www.ic3.gov](https://www.ic3.gov) so that the scammers can be tracked and stopped.

Fraud involving payment of **Federal taxes** should be reported to the [Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration](https://www.treasury.gov/tigta/index.shtml).

Scammers sometimes impersonate the U.S. Department of the Treasury to defraud the public. Learn how to identify and report these scams.

### Common Treasury Scams

#### IRS Impersonation Scams
Callers claim to be from the IRS and demand immediate payment:
- Threaten arrest or deportation
- Demand payment via gift cards or wire transfer
- Use spoofed phone numbers

**Remember**: The IRS will never call demanding immediate payment or threaten arrest.

#### Economic Payment Scams
Scammers contact victims about government payments:
- Promise to expedite stimulus payments
- Request personal information or fees
- Send fake checks or payment notices

**Remember**: Treasury never requires fees to receive payments.

#### Phishing Emails
Emails appearing to be from Treasury:
- Request personal or financial information
- Contain suspicious links or attachments
- Use official-looking logos and formatting

**Remember**: Don't click links in unexpected emails.

### How to Protect Yourself

1. **Be Skeptical** - Question unexpected contacts about money
2. **Verify Independently** - Look up official contact information
3. **Never Pay in Unusual Ways** - Gift cards, wire transfers, cryptocurrency
4. **Protect Personal Information** - Don't share Social Security numbers
5. **Report Suspicious Activity** - Help protect others

There are numerous telephone and email scams in which individuals claim to be employees of the Treasury Department. These scammers often state that they are from the "Department of Legal Affairs," offer grant money in exchange for you wiring a small payment, or threaten to arrest you within a short period of time unless payment is made. Do not provide personal information or payment to these individuals. Their actions are crimes under Titles 18 and 31 of the United States Code.

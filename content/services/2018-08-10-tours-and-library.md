### Historic Treasury Building

The Office of the Treasury Curator hosts guided tours of the historic Treasury Building in Washington. Tours of the Treasury Building require advance reservations made through your Congressional offices. Space is limited.

 

### Library

Members of the public are welcome to make an appointment to research using Treasury Library holdings in the Treasury Library.  All visitors to the Treasury Library must be cleared by the Secret Service.  This process requires that requests for appointments must be made at least one business day before a visit.
